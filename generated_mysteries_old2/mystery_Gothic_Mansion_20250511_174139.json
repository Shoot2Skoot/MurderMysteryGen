        "motive": "Langley harbored a deep resentment toward Eleanor for discrediting his most cherished theory about a manuscript's origins, believing she deliberately sabotaged his reputation and blocked his path to forbidden knowledge; eliminating her was his twisted means to reclaim academic dominance and access secrets he felt were unjustly withheld.",
