# The Case of the Archaeology Team in an Ancient Egyptian Tomb Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Dr. Selim Naguib
- **Occupation:** Senior archaeologist specializing in ancient Egyptian burial rites who secretly leads treasure recovery efforts under the guise of academic research.
- **Personality:** Meticulously methodical and outwardly disciplined, yet harbors a reckless ambition and disregard for superstition that alienates his peers.
- **Cause of Death:** Trapped within a sealed burial chamber rigged with heat-venting traps, Dr. Naguib succumbed to fatal overheating when the ancient ventilation puzzles were maliciously tampered with.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Tariq Haddad:** A resourceful logistics coordinator known for his unflappable calm under pressure, yet behind his composed exterior lies a past as a black market antiquities broker seeking to leverage Naguib’s secret for personal gain. Relationship to Victim: Responsible for field operations and supplies, he was an enabler of Naguib’s clandestine treasure pursuits but also a rival for control over the loot.
- **Amira Zahra:** An expert epigrapher whose quiet demeanor masks a fierce protectiveness over Egypt’s heritage; she secretly despises the treasure hunting that taints their work, harboring a dangerous resolve to stop it (primary and secret motives). Relationship to Victim: Former protégé of Dr. Naguib, who she respected academically but increasingly distrusted as his greed surfaced.
- **Lena Vogel:** A determined cultural anthropologist fascinated by the myths surrounding the tomb; she maintains a skeptical attitude toward the supernatural but privately consults occult experts due to a secret fear of curses. Relationship to Victim: Academic peer with ideological clashes against Naguib’s disregard for tomb superstition, fueling professional rivalry and personal unease.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Fragments of a hidden journal found beneath Lena’s sleeping mat, containing impassioned reflections on the dangers of Dr. Naguib’s reckless excavations, shielding her personal fear and respect behind scholarly observations.
2. Eyewitness accounts recall Amira frequently requesting unsupervised access to the sealed burial chamber during the main team's excavation shifts, sometimes entering alone to 're-verify inscriptions.'
3. A delicate fragment of papyrus inscribed with intricate hieroglyphics was found tucked inside Amira Zahra's journal. The glyphs include detailed notations about the tomb's ventilation system inscriptions, marked with subtle alterations not matched elsewhere, suggesting focused study and possible attempts at manipulation.
4. A witness account from a team member reporting Tariq spent several late nights alone in the tomb corridors inspecting the ventilation shafts just days before Dr. Naguib’s death.
5. A set of sealed ritual tools, found tucked into Lena’s backpack, matching those used during the final chamber sealing ceremony; her fingerprints are faintly detected on the intricate puzzle controls, indicating her physical opportunity to alter conditions unnoticed.
6. An unsigned blueprint of the tomb’s ventilation system found folded inside Tariq’s locker, annotated with precise notes on airflow adjustments near the burial chamber.
7. An expertly sketched alteration map of the tomb's ventilation system, annotated in Lena's precise handwriting, cleverly disguising her sabotage within what appears at first glance as academic commentary on mythological symbolism.
