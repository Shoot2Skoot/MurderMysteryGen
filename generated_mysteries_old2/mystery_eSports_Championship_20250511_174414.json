        "motive": "Marcela's years of being eclipsed by Seo-yeon's innovative strategies fostered a deep-seated resentment that transcended competition; she believed Seo-yeon’s success unjustly stifled her own potential legacy, driving her to eliminate the rival she perceived as a personal and professional obstacle to her rightful prominence.",
        "opportunity": "During the finals, Marcela exploited a rare procedural lapse allowing rival captains limited backstage access to the arena’s tech zones, timing her intervention precisely when Seo-yeon was alone monitoring server performance in the server room, leveraging her familiarity with the championship’s technical protocols to avoid detection."
