# The Case of the Cyberpunk Corporate Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Kaelin Rhee
- **Occupation:** Quantum Data Broker specializing in black-market neural interface transactions and corporate espionage.
- **Personality:** Calculating and charismatic negotiator (primary). Deeply distrustful and secretive about personal alliances (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Environmental sabotage executed by remotely triggering a heavy, augmented reality holo-projector rig above Kaelin's penthouse office to detach and plummet, exploiting an overlooked structural weakness in the megatower's maintenance grid, causing fatal impalement through the reinforced glass ceiling.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Dr. Mira Solis:** A pioneering cyberneticist known for her avant-garde neural implants and cold pragmatism in the corporate world. Beneath her composed exterior, she harbors a fragile vendetta stemming from lost patents she blames on Kaelin's espionage tactics. Relationship to Victim: Former collaborator turned rival who accused Kaelin of corporate sabotage and intellectual theft.
- **Selene Voss:** An enigmatic executive in charge of security for a competing megacorp, publicly ruthless and sharp-tongued. Privately, she wrestles with conflicting loyalties after Kaelin threatened to expose unsavory corporate secrets that could destroy her family's legacy. Relationship to Victim: Corporate adversary with a personal stake entangled in Kaelin's web of espionage and secrets.
- **Jax Rourke:** A streetwise fixer and information broker who thrives in the city's underbelly, recognized for his charismatic charm and encrypted loyalty. Secretly, Jax once supplied Kaelin with illicit neural tech but resents being double-crossed in a failed deal. Relationship to Victim: Black-market supplier and uneasy partner harboring grudges over broken trust and lost profits.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Fragments of a shattered AR holo-projector lens found in the maintenance tunnel's hidden control panel, inscribed faintly with Jax Rourke's hacker tag — a signature known only within the city's underground tech circles.
2. A discarded corporate memo hints at Selene's concerns over potential data leaks from Kaelin, reflecting a deep professional rivalry and possible fear of reputational damage within megacorp circles.
3. Encrypted logs from Selene's command center show her initiating a remote session with the environmental controls exactly during the megatower's scheduled cyber-upgrade window—an operation only authorized for top security officers.
4. A worn, discreet keycard granting access to a rarely used maintenance tunnel beneath the megatower, discovered in Jax's possession along with black-market cybernetic override modules—tools essential for covert infiltration and system manipulation during late hours.
5. A corrupted data cache retrieved from Jax's encrypted cyberdeck containing clandestine communications where Kaelin is viciously confronted and threatened for betrayal over a neural tech deal gone sour, hinting at deep-seated grudges and plotted vengeance.
6. A series of aggressive emails and digital threats sent from Mira’s corporate account to Kaelin Rhee months before the incident, expressing rage and warnings to stop interfering with her intellectual property.
7. An encrypted set of AR system schematics found on Mira Solis’ secure company cloud folder, detailing vulnerabilities in the megatower’s holographic projector controls. The files include hand-annotated notes pointing to ways to disable safety overrides remotely.
