        "motive": "Haunted by guilt from previous covert sabotage that caused collateral damage, Draven feared Lena's impending data leak would ignite a brutal corporate war, risking innocent lives once more; eliminating her was a grim act of prevention to contain the damage and keep his hidden conscience from shattering.",
        "opportunity": "Leveraging his security clearance and intimate access to the megatower's maintenance schedules, Draven arranged a late-night hardware sweep in Lena's usual data cache hub, timing the firmware implant while security protocols were routinely relaxed and Lena was distracted by a scheduled encrypted data exchange."

        "motive": "Despite their estrangement, Sera's motive stemmed from a tangled mix of sibling betrayal and corporate manipulation that fractured their family; she resented Lena for aligning with enemies of their shared past and sought to sever ties permanently to prevent further harm to what remained of their bloodline and her own standing in the shadow economy.",
        "opportunity": "Sera orchestrated a clandestine meeting inside a neutral, heavily surveilled megatower lounge where Lena trusted her guard would be down; with her intimate knowledge of her sister's routines and trust patterns, Sera exploited this rare vulnerability to implant the trap unnoticed."
