        "means": "Dr. Helena Marlowe exploited her knowledge of the tomb's mechanisms, deliberately repositioning the sandstone marker to trigger the ancient scythe trap remotely. She timed this subtle manipulation to activate the concealed blade without direct presence, masking her involvement as an 'accidental' disturbance by Dr. Anwar.",
        "motive": "Helena resented Selim's rigid preservationist stance, which stifled her ambition to make headline discoveries; fearing exposure of her prior scandal involving artifact tampering that Selim threatened to reveal, she decided eliminating him would clear her path to lead the excavation and rewrite the tomb's story on her terms.",
        "opportunity": "During a critical moment when Selim was alone inspecting the burial chamber, Helena had exclusive after-hours access to the tomb, using her expertise to navigate the traps and rearrange the sandstone marker undetected, knowing Selim would soon disturb it during his ritualistic survey."

        "motive": "Omar, deeply committed to protecting his community's heritage, feared that Dr. Anwar's excavation practices would desecrate sacred ground and expose the tomb to irreversible damage, prompting him to eliminate the lead archaeologist to halt the team's progress and safeguard the tomb's sanctity.",
        "opportunity": "As the trusted local guide, Omar had unique, unsupervised access to the inner chambers and was able to move freely within the tomb without raising suspicion, enabling him to tamper with the sandstone marker during the preparations before Dr. Anwar's examination, capitalizing on his knowledge of both traditional lore and trap mechanisms."

        "motive": "Driven by a compulsive desire to prove the existence and lethal reality of the tomb's curse—partly fueled by guilt over a past excavation accident that claimed a loved one—Nasr sought to silence Dr. Selim Anwar, whose scientific arrogance threatened to publicly debunk and discredit her lifelong pursuit of forbidden knowledge and the supernatural aspects of Egyptology.",
        "opportunity": "During the day's final examination of the burial chamber, Nasr had exclusive unsupervised access to the sandstone marker and surrounding floor tiles while other team members documented nearby artifacts; her intimate knowledge of the hieroglyphic warnings and tomb architecture granted her the timing and means to reposition trap triggers without attracting suspicion."
