# The Case of the eSports Championship Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Jordan Kade
- **Occupation:** Professional eSports team strategist and coach, specializing in real-time strategy games with a reputation for psychological manipulation tactics.
- **Personality:** Hyper-competitive and calculated (primary). Beneath this fa√ßade, prone to intense anxiety and self-doubt, often masking it with bravado (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Fatal allergic reaction triggered by a swapped nootropic supplement designed to enhance focus, which was replaced covertly with a chemically similar but deadly compound causing anaphylaxis during a high-pressure tournament match.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Dmitri Volkov:** An enigmatic eSports analyst with a reputation for eerie prediction accuracy who often provides data-driven insights (primary). Behind the scenes, he is involved in underground betting circles and secret manipulation of match outcomes to maximize profits (secret). Relationship to Victim: Consultant whose advice Jordan distrusted, leading to public disputes but covert interactions related to tournament stakes.
- **Lena Cho:** A former prodigy player turned team captain known for her calm under pressure and strategic genius (primary). However, she harbors a deep resentment toward Jordan for publicly undermining her mental health struggles and blocking her leadership ambitions (secondary). Relationship to Victim: Current team captain who clashed frequently with Jordan over control and direction of the team.
- **Nia Rivera:** A tech-savvy equipment manager with access to all team supplements and hardware, known for her loyal and supportive demeanor toward players (primary). She is quietly suffering from financial troubles and a gambling addiction, making her vulnerable to coercion (hidden vulnerability). Relationship to Victim: Responsible for logistics and player gear, thus the sole person with easy access to Jordan's personal nootropic supplement.

## The Evidence

1. A small vial labeled with an official supplement brand logo, found concealed in Nia Rivera's locker, containing a clear liquid that chemical analysis later identified as the lethal substance used in the poison swap.
2. A digital printout of an internal team chat where Lena argued heatedly with Jordan days before the tournament over leadership roles, loaded with sharp, personal criticisms.
3. A series of encrypted text messages on Nia Rivera's phone reveal desperate negotiations with anonymous figures demanding she sabotage Jordan, peppered with threats clarifying the severe consequences of failure.
4. Eyewitness accounts from two team members place Nia alone inside the secluded locker room moments before the championship match, seen handling players' equipment and supplements with an air of nervous urgency not typical of her.
5. A USB drive labeled 'Strategy Secrets' hidden in Dmitri's locker contains detailed notes about Jordan's supplement routine and practice schedules, indicating intimate knowledge of his habits.
6. An anonymous tip sent to team management revealed surveillance footage showing Lena lingering suspiciously near Jordan's equipment bag during the match break, moments before his collapse.
