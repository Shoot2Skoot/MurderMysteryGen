# The Case of the Gothic Mansion Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Eleanora Vexley
- **Occupation:** Historian and caretaker of the ancestral gothic mansion, specializing in arcane artifacts and family secrets.
- **Personality:** Eloquent and enigmatic with a commanding presence (primary). Beneath her composure lies a deeply insecure and secretive nature, fearful of her own family's legacy (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Struck fatally by a razor-sharp, antique crossbow arrow rigged to release from a creaking ceiling gargoyle statue, triggered by a sabotaged counterweight mechanism designed to topple a chandelier.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Father Sebastian Kerr:** A charismatic yet secretive clergyman who visits the mansion to 'help cleanse' the family’s cursed legacy (primary). Holds a hidden fascination with dark rituals and forbidden knowledge discovered through Eleanora’s research (concealed obsession). Relationship to Victim: Spiritual advisor invited by Eleanora, whose intentions may mask a deeper involvement with the mansion's arcane mysteries.
- **Isabella Crowhurst:** A sharp-witted antiquarian and distant relative obsessed with reclaiming the family fortune, presenting herself as a loyal kin (primary). Behind the facade, she manipulates family lore to conceal her illicit dealings in black market relics (secret life). Relationship to Victim: Distant cousin who frequently disputed the legitimacy of Eleanora's stewardship and claims to the estate.
- **Victor Graves:** A brooding architect with expertise in unsolved mechanical devices, outwardly calm and methodical (primary). Secretly harbors resentment for the Vexley family due to a scandal that destroyed his father's reputation (hidden grudge). Relationship to Victim: Former collaborator on mansion renovations who clashed frequently over the preservation of arcane artifacts.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. A faded diary entry found tucked inside a worn Bible referencing frustrations over Eleanora's reluctance to embrace the mansion's occult secrets and a cryptic note about 'opening gates by any means necessary'.
2. A set of old blueprints of the mansion with detailed annotations in Father Sebastian's handwriting, highlighting sacred symbols and mechanisms near the grand hall chandelier.
3. A meticulously detailed blueprint of the gargoyle statue's internal mechanism, stained faintly with dust but recently disturbed, found tucked inside Victor Graves's private study desk drawer. Cryptic annotations in Victor's handwriting mark the precise spot where the crossbow mechanism is triggered.
4. An anonymous tip describes hearing Isabella boasting in a dimly lit tavern about her 'inside knowledge' of the mansion’s secret passages and arcane relics, hinting she could manipulate the environment to her advantage.
5. An old family ledger detailing the disgrace of Victor’s father at the hands of the Vexley family, accompanied by a fiercely penned journal entry from Victor expressing his simmering fury and his intent to dismantle their legacy.
6. A torn ledger page is found in the mansion's library, listing payments made by Isabella to various craftsmen, including a clockmaker, though no record links her directly to mechanical sabotage equipment.
7. A witness’s hushed testimony describing Victor slipping away from the group under the guise of inspecting the upper gallery’s structural integrity, coinciding exactly with the time Eleanora was found dead beneath the gargoyle statue.
