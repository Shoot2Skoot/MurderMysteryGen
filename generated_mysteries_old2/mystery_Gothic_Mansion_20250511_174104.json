        "motive": "Driven by his obsession with the Blackwood family's occult legacy and frustrated by being confined to the role of mere physician, Lucien sought to eliminate Evelyn to claim stewardship of the ancestral secrets and artifacts, believing that with her gone, he could unlock and harness the mansion's arcane powers for his own transcendence.",
        "opportunity": "During the clandestine ritual in the mansion's dimly lit ceremonial chamber—a setting only accessible to those trusted within the household—Lucien used his position as Evelyn's physician and authorized ritual attendant to gain close, unsupervised proximity to her, timing the injection to coincide with a moment of ritual distraction that only someone with his knowledge of the mansion's customs would anticipate."
