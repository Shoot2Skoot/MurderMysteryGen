# The Case of the eSports Championship Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Jin Seo-yeon
- **Occupation:** Professional eSports strategist and team captain for a leading global MOBA team, known for innovative, high-risk plays and groundbreaking game analyses.
- **Personality:** Calculating and charismatic in public (primary). Privately suffers from intense paranoia and distrust towards teammates and management (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Deliberately subjected to fatal overheating by being trapped in the highly climate-controlled eSports arena server room, where intense computational heat was ramped up remotely, exploiting the victim's need to oversee technical operations under extreme conditions until critical organ failure occurred.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Elias Tanaka:** The team's lead technician and systems engineer, highly regarded for his expertise in game server architecture and technical problem-solving (primary). However, he struggles with anxiety and feelings of invisibility within the team, often pushing boundaries to gain recognition (secondary motive). Relationship to Victim: Responsible for maintaining the arena's technical systems and was often overlooked by Seo-yeon despite his critical support role.
- **Marcela Ortiz:** A sharp-minded rival team captain known for her flawless gameplay and unwavering confidence in tournaments (primary). Beneath her composed exterior, she secretly harbors deep resentment towards Seo-yeon for overshadowing her rise in the eSports community (hidden grudge). Relationship to Victim: Fierce competitor whose team frequently lost to Seo-yeon's leadership, fueling a rivalry that blurred personal and professional lines.
- **Lily Chen:** An ambitious junior strategist recently promoted to assistant coach, known for her meticulous approach and eagerness to innovate (primary). Secretly, she engineered internal discord to unseat Seo-yeon, viewing the captain’s paranoia as a weakness to exploit for her own advancement (hidden manipulation). Relationship to Victim: Protégé turned schemer, outwardly loyal but privately undermining Seo-yeon's authority within the team.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Security camera footage showing Marcela lingering near the backstage tech zones during an allowed window, carefully observing the server room entrance without any attempt to enter or tamper.
2. Technical logs recovered from the championship server room reveal unauthorized remote commands issued during the final match, subtly manipulated to increase the temperature while bypassing sensor alarms. The IP trace points back to Lily's coaching console.
3. An overheard hallway conversation where a tech crew member mentions Marcela repeatedly asking about the old server room layouts and environmental control systems days before the finals.
4. A journal found in Lily's locker contains passionate entries lamenting Seo-yeon's 'paranoia' and detailing Lily's vision for the team's future under her guidance, expressing frustration and ambition intertwined with a resolve to take decisive action.
5. An overheard conversation from the night of the incident captures Elias debating timing with another staff member regarding the server room access, implying knowledge of the security routines but not direct control over them.
6. A hastily discarded smartphone found near Elias Tanaka's locker contains a series of encrypted messages hinting at his frustrations, but the final messages abruptly stop short of any incriminating plans.
7. CCTV footage shows Lily entering the server room shortly before the fatal overheating, during a critical technical check-up, at a time when other staff members were engrossed in a heated match dispute, providing an unobserved window to manipulate systems.
