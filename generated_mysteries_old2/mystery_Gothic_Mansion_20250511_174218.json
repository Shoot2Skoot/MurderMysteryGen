        "means": "Victor Graves engineered the ceiling gargoyle statue's hidden counterweight mechanism with intimate knowledge of the mansion's archaic architecture, allowing him to remotely trigger the antique crossbow arrow, disguised as part of the mansion's eerie décor, to strike Eleanora fatally.",
        "motive": "Victor resented Eleanora for obstructing his architectural revisions and preservation plans, but more deeply, he sought revenge against the Vexley family whom he blamed for his father's disgrace, believing that eliminating Eleanora would symbolically dismantle their legacy and clear his family name.",
        "opportunity": "During a private walkthrough of the mansion's upper gallery—an area restricted and familiar only to those deeply involved in renovation—Victor had both exclusive access and perfect timing to manipulate the rigged gargoyle mechanism unnoticed, capitalizing on Eleanora's trust in his expertise and her distraction by archival research."

        "motive": "Driven by a desperate need to secure the family fortune, Isabella viewed Eleanora's legitimate stewardship and scholarly reputation as obstacles; her covert black market dealings in relics would be exposed and ruined if Eleanora maintained control, prompting her to eliminate her rival under the guise of loyalty.",
        "opportunity": "Taking advantage of her frequent unsupervised access to the mansion's restricted artifact rooms and recent renovations to the chandelier's rigging, Isabella had both the time and specialized knowledge to tamper with the cursed gargoyle and counterweight system days before the fatal incident, ensuring she could trigger the trap at the perfect moment."
