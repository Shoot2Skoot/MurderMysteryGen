    "cause_of_death": "Fatally stabbed by a ceremonial dagger concealed within a seemingly ordinary sarcophagus during an excavation; the blade was uniquely designed to shatter a hidden, ancient seal, triggering localized fires in the tomb's passage, but the direct cause was the stabbing itself."

        "means": "Professor Kayyam exploited his intimate knowledge of the tomb's layout and Dr. Nasir's routines to rig the ceremonial dagger within the sarcophagus's secret compartment, disguising it as a harmless relic; when Nasir opened it, the blade silently released and stabbed her before shattering the ancient seal to mask the act as an accident linked to the tomb's curse.",
        "motive": "Despite his public rationalism, Kayyam was driven by a simmering jealousy over Nasir's recognition and leadership; frustrated by being overshadowed and eager to seize control of the excavation's key discoveries, he sought to remove her under the guise of ancient retribution to safeguard his ambitions without outright scandal.",
        "opportunity": "During a rare moment when Nasir worked alone translating inscriptions inside the sealed inner chamber, Kayyam used his exclusive access during a brief personnel shift change to plant the rigged dagger and ensure he was the only other person with access at that vulnerable time."

        "motive": "Driven by genuine fear and reverence for the ancient spirits, Amina believed that Dr. Nasir's dismissive, rational approach was violating sacred boundaries, risking catastrophic curses; she saw eliminating Laila as a necessary act to protect the tomb's sanctity and prevent further desecration.",
