    "cause_of_death": "Subjected to a deliberately engineered induced allergic reaction triggered by exposure to ancient fumigation chemicals—resins and incense residues specifically chosen for her known sensitivity—released within the sealed inner sanctum of the tomb, causing rapid and fatal anaphylaxis in the stifling tomb environment."

        "motive": "Anwar's mounting desperation to produce a groundbreaking discovery clashed with Lydia's meticulous critiques that threatened to undermine his interpretations and stall the excavation's prestige; beyond professional rivalry, he feared that her skepticism would expose his ethical compromises and ruin his career at a critical juncture, driving him to silence her permanently.",
        "opportunity": "As the team prepared to enter the forbidden inner sanctum—accessible only under Anwar's direct authorization and timing—he exploited his exclusive control over the tomb’s sealed environment and the ritual clearing procedures, scheduling the release of the allergens precisely when Lydia would be most vulnerable and isolated within the stifling chamber."

        "motive": "Jealous of Dr. Massara’s dominant role and innovative interpretations that continually overshadowed her own research, Dr. Khalil grew resentful, believing that eliminating Massara would finally catapult her into the spotlight and secure coveted funding and academic prestige she felt she deserved yet was persistently denied.",
