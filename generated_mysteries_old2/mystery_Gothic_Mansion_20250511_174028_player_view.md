# The Case of the Gothic Mansion Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Evelyn Harrow
- **Occupation:** Antique Curator specializing in rare and cursed artifacts inherited by the mansion's family lineage.
- **Personality:** Meticulously detail-oriented and fiercely protective of the mansion's legacy (primary). Conceals a deep skepticism of the supernatural and a habit of secretly testing supposedly cursed items to debunk myths (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Victim died as a result of environmental sabotage where the antique gas chandelier’s safety valve was deliberately disabled, causing a slow leak of gas that filled the mansion's main hall. The leak was subtle and went unnoticed until the gas reached lethal concentrations, leading to fatal asphyxiation during a grand evening event.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Vivienne Grey:** A charming socialite and art dealer with a knack for manipulating high society (primary). Beneath her polished veneer lies a desperate need to acquire rare antiques by any means, even if it means sabotaging rivals. Relationship to Victim: Professional rival who envied Evelyn's exclusive access to the mansion's cursed collection.
- **Dr. Elias Trench:** A pragmatic chemist called in to authenticate the artifacts' materials, known for his rational mindset (primary). However, he hides a history of gambling debts that Evelyn recently threatened to expose, giving him a dangerous motive. Relationship to Victim: Consultant uneasy under Evelyn's scrutiny and warnings about his questionable past.
- **Julian Morcant:** The mansion's reclusive historian who prides himself on preserving family secrets (primary). Though outwardly loyal, he secretly resents Evelyn's empirical skepticism as it threatens to expose legends he wishes to keep alive for influence. Relationship to Victim: Long-time family retainer who clashed with Evelyn over revealing the mansion's hidden past.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Several receipts from the town’s gambling houses were found tucked inside Dr. Trench’s locked study drawer, revealing significant and repeated bets placed over the past months.
2. Multiple eyewitnesses recall seeing Vivienne moving freely in the restricted gallery area during the chaotic pre-event setup, a moment when staff attention was divided, giving her the precise opportunity to tamper with the chandelier unnoticed.
3. In Julian Morcant's private study, a journal entry was discovered expressing his frustration over Evelyn Harrow's plans to publish her findings, lamenting how it might 'strip away the mansion's very soul' and threaten the family's legacy.
4. A finely crafted wrench with chemical-resistant grips was recovered from the garden maze, bearing faint traces of an oily residue. It matches tools commonly used by skilled chemists for delicate adjustments in mechanisms.
5. A secret ledger hidden inside Vivienne's personal satchel reveals a detailed plan outlining the strategic removal of Evelyn, with notes emphasizing the desire to claim sole ownership of the mansion’s rare artifacts and the expected auction profits.
6. An old, ornate key bearing the mansion's family crest was found tucked within Julian’s coat pocket, a key that grants access to the restricted attic, where the infamous gas chandelier's mechanism is installed.
7. Underneath the antique gas chandelier, a faint trace of a specialized solvent used in art restoration was detected—a chemical uniquely used by Vivienne in her workshop, suggesting her hands delicately disabled the safety valve without leaving marks.
