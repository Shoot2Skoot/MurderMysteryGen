# The Case of the Cyberpunk Corporate Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Elara Voss
- **Occupation:** Cybernetic Ethics Compliance Officer at NovaTek Corporation, responsible for policing internal research abuses with cutting-edge biotech.
- **Personality:** Principled and incorruptible in public (primary). Privately conflicted by her reliance on illegal cybernetic enhancements to maintain performance and poise under corporate pressure (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Victim was killed by a lethal injection digitally triggered through her own neural implant—a form of Technological Sabotage—where a sabotaged nano-infused drug cartridge in her medical injector delivered a toxin directly into her bloodstream during a routine compliance check, bypassing all external detection.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Dr. Kaelen Rix:** The head of NovaTek's experimental biotech division, brilliant but burdened by a trail of failed projects that could have ruined his career (primary). He harbors a covert obsession with pushing ethical boundaries to achieve breakthroughs, often clashing in secret with Elara's compliance efforts (hidden). Relationship to Victim: Professional rival whose research was repeatedly flagged and threatened by Elara's investigations.
- **Lira Xun:** A skilled netrunner and freelance hacker who specializes in corporate espionage, known for her calm demeanor and precise methods (primary). Secretly, she once owed Elara a life debt after Elara saved her from a dangerous crackdown, complicating her loyalties (hidden). Relationship to Victim: Former informant and reluctant ally who shared insider information with Elara under duress.
- **Cassian Tyre:** An ambitious junior executive climbing NovaTek's ranks, outwardly charismatic and eager to please (primary). Beneath the surface, he is deeply enmeshed in underground augment black markets, which Elara threatened to expose (hidden). Relationship to Victim: Internal corporate subordinate whose illicit dealings were jeopardized by Elara's relentless compliance enforcement.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Access logs showing Dr. Kaelen Rix's presence in the secured biotech supply vault during off-hours, including a recorded biometric entry exactly 15 minutes before Elara's fatal compliance check, despite no scheduled maintenance.
2. A series of encrypted lab notebook entries on Kaelen's personal neuro-deck, filled with impassioned and increasingly desperate writings about the 'stifling ethical constraints' imposed by Elara Voss, culminating in a cryptic plan to 'remove the final barrier' to his research’s evolution.
3. A series of encrypted chat logs recovered from a hidden cache within Cassian Tyre's corporate workstation, detailing his extensive dealings in unauthorized cybernetic augment black market transactions, including cryptic references to payments linked to 'silencing compliance'.
4. Encrypted chat logs recovered from the neon-lit backchannels of the megatower’s net, depicting Lira Xun and Elara exchanging coded gratitude messages shortly before the incident. Lira assures Elara of discreet collaboration, hinting at a protective alliance rather than hostility.
5. A set of access timestamps within the system logs coinciding precisely with Lira's assigned maintenance window, showing normal diagnostic commands but no signs of malicious activity.
6. A discarded medical injector cartridge case found hidden beneath the floor panel in Dr. Kaelen Rix's laboratory, embossed with the NovaTek compliance insignia but microscopically altered to include a hidden nano-scale toxin reservoir.
7. A corporate Wi-Fi usage map highlighting Cassian's presence within the restricted biotech wing around the times medical injector devices were replenished, pointing to his opportunity to interact with Elara's medical equipment despite lack of physical tampering evidence.
