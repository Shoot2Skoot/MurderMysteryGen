    "cause_of_death": "Trapped within the burial chamber's inner sanctum as heat was artificially intensified by a sabotaged thermal regulation system, causing fatal overheating designed to emulate the tomb's legendary curse of the sun god, ultimately inducing lethal heatstroke amid the claustrophobic maze of narrow passages."

        "motive": "Feeling perpetually marginalized and overshadowed by Dr. Hassan's domineering leadership and public acclaim, Omar sought to eliminate her to seize control of the excavation, aiming to prove his own worth and secure recognition for his critical engineering expertise.",
        "opportunity": "Having exclusive access and authority over the tomb's complex safety and environmental controls, Omar was able to discreetly sabotage the thermal system during a routine maintenance check when other team members were absent, timing the temperature rise precisely during the intensive exploration of the inner sanctum when Dr. Hassan was isolated."

This sabotage cleverly mimicked the legendary curse of the sun god by using hidden heat emitters wired into the tomb’s delicate infrastructure, a method only possible with his unique combination of military technical skills and insider access.",
        "motive": "Faisal feared that Dr. Hassan's meticulous record-keeping and ethical stance would expose his illicit smuggling operations; her growing suspicion threatened to unravel his carefully managed cover. By eliminating her, he aimed to destabilize the team's leadership and create chaos that would distract from his smuggling activities, securing his profits and evading accountability while taking advantage of the tomb's superstitious aura to mask the crime.",
        "opportunity": "As the official security officer, Faisal had unrestricted access to the excavation's control systems at all hours, including during late-night shifts when the team was off guard. He exploited a scheduled maintenance window for the tomb's environmental systems to discreetly reprogram the thermal regulators, timing the fatal rise in temperature to coincide with Dr. Hassan's solo exploration of the tightest inner chambers where escape routes were limited, ensuring her incapacitation before help could arrive."
