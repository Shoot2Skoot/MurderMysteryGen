# The Case of the Gothic Mansion Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Eleanora Blackwood
- **Occupation:** Heir and curator of the ancestral Blackwood estate, responsible for preserving its dark and arcane history through a private collection of rare manuscripts and artifacts.
- **Personality:** Elegantly poised and intellectually curious, with a deep appreciation for the mansion’s mysteries (primary). Beneath this facade, she harbors a ruthless streak and secret resentment towards family members competing for inheritance (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Mortally injured by a cleverly concealed booby trap within the mansion’s ancient library: a hidden compartment triggered an explosive device fashioned from antique gunpowder barrels, set off by the disturbance of a specific tome linked to family secrets. This unique, thematic use of an explosive booby trap combined gothic antiquity with lethal intent.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Sebastian Crowley:** A brooding scholar of occult studies with an obsession for the Blackwood family's arcane artifacts (primary). Secretly, he harbors a hidden vendetta over a disputed artifact he believes rightfully belongs to him, fueling his quiet resentment (secret motive). Relationship to Victim: Former research collaborator who felt betrayed after being cut out of the Blackwood estate's latest acquisition.
- **Alistair Blackwood:** Eleanora’s estranged cousin, a charismatic but volatile figure who has struggled with debts and scandal (primary). Beneath his charm lies a simmering jealousy and a desperate hope to reclaim his perceived birthright through drastic measures (concealed resentment). Relationship to Victim: Family member engaged in a bitter rivalry over the Blackwood inheritance and estate control.
- **Vivienne Hawthorne:** The enigmatic governess of the Blackwood estate, outwardly loyal and protective of the mansion's legacy (primary). Unknown to most, she secretly manipulates family dynamics to secure a mysterious inheritance tied to the estate's dark history (hidden ambition). Relationship to Victim: Caretaker and confidante to Eleanora, but with concealed ambitions for control of the estate.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. An unfinished manuscript penned in Sebastian's handwriting reveals his growing bitterness and obsession with reclaiming the family's arcane artifacts, explicitly naming the disputed relic as 'rightfully mine' and expressing deep resentment towards Eleanora's exclusive ownership.
2. A ledger discovered in Vivienne Hawthorne's private quarters, meticulously detailing the mansion's secret passage schedules and her nightly movements around the estate during the family gathering. Entries note the exact timing of Eleanora's planned library visit.
3. Library staff recall Sebastian requesting unmonitored late-night access to the Blackwood estate under the pretense of researching obscure manuscripts, coinciding suspiciously with the days before the explosion.
4. Within the shattered remnants of the library's hidden compartment, a small, intricately engraved key bearing Sebastian Crowley's personal crest is found, its delicate mechanism clearly designed to arm the antique gunpowder barrels invisibly triggered by removing a certain tome.
5. An old letter penned by Vivienne expressing intense frustration over being barred from the full inheritance and lamenting her limited role, found tucked inside an ancient family volume she was supposedly cataloging.
6. An overheard conversation at the charity event about Alistair discussing, rather vaguely but insistently, his grudge against Eleanora and his claims to the estate's control, caught on a guest's recording but lacking any direct threat or plan.
7. An ornate, leather-bound ledger discovered hidden in Alistair Blackwood's study, containing detailed notes of the mansion's secret passageways and their historical uses, including sketches matching the locations of gunpowder barrels in family records.
