        "motive": "She viewed Dr. Naguib as a betrayer of their scholarly mission, believing his treasure hunting irreparably desecrated the tomb and its heritage; her deep respect for cultural preservation drove her to eliminate him to prevent further exploitation and protect the sanctity of Egypt’s history.",
        "opportunity": "As the team's trusted epigrapher, Amira regularly accessed the sealed burial chamber to document and decipher inscriptions, granting her unique, unsupervised moments alone to tamper with the ventilation mechanisms, timed perfectly during a routine inspection when others were distracted by external excavation activities."

        "motive": "Though outwardly supportive of Dr. Naguib’s academic guise, Tariq’s true ambition was to wrest control of the treasure recovery operation; resentment grew as Naguib marginalized him in key decisions, so Tariq chose to eliminate him to seize full command of the lucrative black market dealings tied to the excavation.",
        "opportunity": "Tariq, overseeing field logistics, regularly entered the tomb's deeper passages unseen by others, granting him exclusive nocturnal access when the team retired; during these solitary hours, he expertly tampered with the ventilation controls, confident his covert alterations would go undetected until it was too late."
