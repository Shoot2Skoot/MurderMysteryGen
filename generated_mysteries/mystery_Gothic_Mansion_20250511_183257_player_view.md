# The Case of the Gothic Mansion Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Eleanor Blackwood
- **Occupation:** Heiress and curator of an ancestral collection of arcane artifacts within the family’s centuries-old mansion, entangled in preserving occult secrets.
- **Personality:** Elegantly composed and commanding in public (primary), yet privately haunted by doubt and a fascination with forbidden dark lore (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Administered a lethal injection composed of a rare venom distilled from a gothic plant found only in the family estate’s overgrown gardens, cleverly disguised as a restorative tonic.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Isadora Vane:** Charismatic family lawyer with a sharp mind for manipulation (primary). Secretly obsessed with uncovering forbidden knowledge to secure the family legacy under her control (hidden agenda). Relationship to Victim: Legal advisor to Eleanor who also contests some of her decisions regarding the estate's occult holdings.
- **Sebastian Blackwood:** Estranged cousin with a brooding demeanor and deep resentment over inheritance disputes (primary). Privately studies the occult to challenge Eleanor’s authority and prove his worth (hidden ambition). Relationship to Victim: Family member and rival claimant to the ancestral estate and its secrets.
- **Dr. Alaric Graves:** The mansion's reclusive botanist, known for his expertise in rare flora (primary). Conceals a desperate addiction to arcane poisons derived from the estate's garden, risking his sanity (secret). Relationship to Victim: Longtime caretaker of the estate's gardens and reluctant confidant of Eleanor's dark experiments.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. A torn, frantic diary entry discovered in Dr. Graves’ chamber reveals his spiraling obsession with arcane toxins and his mounting dread of Eleanor’s imminent discovery.
2. Witnesses recall hearing Sebastian discuss bitterly with the estate gardeners about disputes over the care of the overgrown gothic plants, suggesting a possible resentful connection to the source of the toxin.
3. A shattered vial labeled with an esoteric symbol lies concealed in the conservatory’s soil, its residue matching the unique venom derived from the mansion’s rare gothic plants.
4. A torn journal page from Isadora reveals ambivalent thoughts about the use of the estate's occult powers, lamenting the dangers rather than plotting control.
5. A worn leather-bound journal discovered in Sebastian's study details the toxic properties and extraction methods of the gothic plant, albeit lacking any mention of the specialized alchemical alteration found in the poison.
6. Witnesses recount seeing Dr. Graves alone in the conservatory late at night, with a suspiciously prepared herbal tonic he handed to Eleanor moments before her ritual.
7. A finely embroidered handkerchief found tucked under a floorboard in the private study bears faint traces of a rare plant toxin, the same found in the garden venoms, but with no proof it was administered maliciously.
