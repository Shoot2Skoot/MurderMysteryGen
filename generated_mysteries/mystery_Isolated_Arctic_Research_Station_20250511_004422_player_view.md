## The Victim
- **Name:** Dr. Ingrid Halvorsen
- **Occupation:** Lead Glaciologist at Northwind Arctic Research Station
- **Personality:** Methodical and fiercely independent, with an unwavering dedication to uncovering the secrets of polar ice dynamics, yet guarded about her past.
- **Cause of Death:** Fatal cerebral embolism caused by microscopic ice crystals injected through a covert breach in the station's atmospheric filtration system, exploiting the extreme cold environment.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Maya Larsen:** A resourceful and secretive communications officer whose past is shrouded in mystery, skilled in digital sabotage and espionage. Relationship to Victim: Station staff member, tasked with managing external communications and security.
- **Captain Rearick:** The stoic and authoritative station commander, responsible for overall safety and operations, known to enforce strict discipline. Relationship to Victim: Station commander overseeing Ingrid's research team.
- **Dr. Erik Svendson:** The station's meteorologist, pragmatic and quietly ambitious, harboring resentment over Ingrid's leadership style and recent research breakthroughs. Relationship to Victim: Professional colleague and scientific rival.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Several crew members recall overhearing Rearick express frustration over Dr. Halvorsen's guarded research and her reluctance to share critical findings, implying tension and a possible motive.
2. A hidden journal entry by Maya expressing her anger and fear about Dr. Halvorsen's plans to reveal security flaws, explicitly stating a desire to stop Ingrid at any cost.
3. Colleagues recall heated arguments where Erik openly challenged Ingrid's leadership and complained about being overshadowed, expressing desire to take over her position.
4. Logs from the station's ventilation control system showing unauthorized access by Maya during the maintenance window coinciding with the time of the victim's illness onset.
5. Swipe card records and CCTV footage confirming Maya's presence alone at the filtration control room during the critical maintenance period with no supervision.
6. Security footage shows Erik entering the station's maintenance wing shortly before the air filtration incident, wearing gloves and carrying a small case.
7. A personal maintenance logbook found in Captain Rearick's private quarters details late-night entries on the atmospheric filtration system's performance, indicating his knowledge and involvement with the controls.
