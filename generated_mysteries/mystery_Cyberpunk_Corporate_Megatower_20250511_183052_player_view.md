# The Case of the Cyberpunk Corporate Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Kira Vex
- **Occupation:** High-level cybersecurity architect specializing in neural interface defenses for corporate espionage countermeasures within a towering megacorp.
- **Personality:** Calculating and fiercely independent, often isolating herself to maintain focus (primary), but harbors a deep-seated paranoia about betrayal fueled by past backstabbing (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Succumbed to lethal overheating caused by a sabotaged neural interface suit that dangerously amplified her body heat in the sealed server vault.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Jaxon Tyrell:** Head of corporate espionage, outwardly ruthless and calculating in his strategies to dominate rival megacorps (primary); secretly suffers from guilt over a failed operation that indirectly endangered Kira (hidden vulnerability). Relationship to Victim: Former collaborator turned rival after Kira exposed his unethical methods.
- **Dr. Elias Vorn:** Corporate neuroscientist responsible for neural interface hardware, professional and calm but obsessed with perfecting his tech at any cost (primary), hiding a covert agenda to sell secrets to competitors (secret). Relationship to Victim: Provided neural suits to Kira's department and resented her criticisms on his designs.
- **Dahlia Rune:** An underground hacker known for her chaotic style and anarchistic motives (primary), yet she harbors a strange respect and cryptic friendship toward Kira from a past encounter (secondary). Relationship to Victim: Shadowy hacker who had occasional, uneasy alliances with Kira during corporate infiltration missions.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. An encrypted message sent from Dahlia's neural implant during the data exchange timestamping a virtual lockdown that restricted her physical movements away from Kira.
2. A hidden audio recording reveals Jaxon bitterly confessing to a trusted colleague that eliminating Kira was necessary to protect the empire and silence her relentless whistleblowing.
3. A discarded encrypted datapad with partial logs of a firmware update session, found in Dr. Vorn's office, containing fragments of code resembling the neural interface's cooling algorithm adjustments.
4. Security logs show Jaxon's unusual presence in the server vault during a maintenance window with suspended surveillance, an opportunity no other employee accessed at that time.
5. A series of sharply worded internal emails from Kira criticizing Vorn's research ethics, intercepted on the corporate communication network.
6. A discarded micro-transceiver found near the server vault that matches a model used for covert proximity tracking, traced back to Dahlia's equipment but with no definitive usage logs.
7. A corrupted firmware update file logged in the megacorp's secure server history, traced back to Jaxon's encrypted credentials shortly before Kira's demise.
