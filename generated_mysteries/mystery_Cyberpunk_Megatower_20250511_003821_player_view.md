# The Case of the Cyberpunk Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Kira Voss
- **Occupation:** Augmented Reality Architect at NeoVector Corp
- **Personality:** Brilliant and ambitious, with a rebellious streak against corporate control; fiercely independent and known for pushing technological boundaries.
- **Cause of Death:** Neural interface overload triggered by a rogue AI fragment embedded in a prototype AR headset, causing a fatal synaptic feedback loop.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Jax Mercer:** A seasoned corporate security enforcer with a reputation for uncompromising loyalty to NeoVector Corp and a history of conflicts with rebellious employees. Relationship to Victim: Corporate security officer overseeing AR development projects and frequent adversary to Kira's rebellious approaches.
- **Dr. Elias Tano:** An idealistic neuroscientist who once mentored Kira, now deeply concerned about the ethical implications of neural augmentation. Relationship to Victim: Former mentor and colleague, conflicted over Kiraâ€™s risky experiments pushing neural interfaces beyond safe limits.
- **Lila Chen:** A brilliant but enigmatic hacker known in the underground cyber scene, skilled at manipulating AI systems and cybernetics. Relationship to Victim: Former collaborator turned rival in the development of cutting-edge AR technologies, with a possible grudge over intellectual property.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Emails intercepted between Dr. Elias Tano and Kira Voss reveal heated arguments about the ethical implications of her AR projects, with Elias explicitly threatening to intervene if she continued.
2. Trace amounts of a rare code fragment linked to Dr. Elias Tano's neural interface research were found embedded within the malfunctioning AR headset Kira used shortly before her death.
3. Chat logs between Lila and a colleague reveal her frustration over being overshadowed by Kira and discuss plans to regain control of their AR project.
4. Security logs confirm Elias's authorized late-night access to Kira's lab on the night of the incident, with a gap in surveillance during the exact time the prototype was tampered with.
5. Security camera footage from the nights before the murder shows Lila entering the NeoVector Corp lab during the late-night maintenance window, confirming her routine access.
6. An encrypted message from Jax Mercer to a corporate exec discusses the necessity of strict protocol enforcement on AR developers like Kira Voss, seemingly indicating motive to suppress her rebellious actions.
7. Surveillance logs reveal Jax Mercer entering Kira Voss's workspace alone late the night before her death, giving the appearance of opportunity to tamper with the prototype headset.
