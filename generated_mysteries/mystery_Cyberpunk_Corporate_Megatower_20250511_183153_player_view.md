## The Victim
- **Name:** Kaela Sorin
- **Occupation:** Corporate Negotiator specializing in high-stakes mergers and hostile takeovers within cyberspace and physical assets.
- **Personality:** Calculating and impeccably poised in public settings, yet privately burdened by paranoia and a compulsive need for control.
- **Cause of Death:** Impaled by a monofilament wire rigged within the megatower's automated window-cleaning drone, a weapon uniquely concealed in corporate urban technology.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Mira Quan:** Charismatic head of competitive mergers with a knack for playing ruthless yet measured corporate strategies; conceals an ongoing vendetta masked by professional respect toward Kaela. Relationship to Victim: Professional rival who lost a pivotal deal due to Kaela's intervention and now seeks retribution.
- **Eliot Renn:** Up-and-coming executive assistant adept at navigating corporate power plays, reputed for his calm exterior concealing a past marked by abandoned whistleblowing attempts. Relationship to Victim: Kaela's personal assistant privy to her paranoia and secret movements within the megatower.
- **Darius Vek:** A reclusive cybersecurity architect known for his cybernetic enhancements that blur human and machine lineages; outwardly a loyal company man but rumored to manipulate corporate data for shadowy personal gains. Relationship to Victim: Lead systems engineer whose project budgets Kaela recently threatened to cut.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. A scratched access card with Eliot's fingerprint was found near the drone control room, accompanied by a generic maintenance schedule showing window-cleaning times.
2. A series of encrypted chat logs hint at Eliot's unease about his past but end abruptly with a reassuring message from Kaela promising protection against corporate backlash.
3. An encrypted terminal log entry reveals an attempted remote access to the drone control system from Darius's workstation, timestamped just an hour before the murder but abruptly cut off by a counter-intrusion protocol.
4. Witness testimony from a security analyst overheard Darius complaining about budget cuts fiercely in the days before Kaela's death, citing ruined cybernetic experiments and personal ruin.
5. Maintenance logs paired with surveillance timestamps confirm Mira accessed the drone control room moments before the attack, coinciding perfectly with Kaela's window-cleaning timetable.
6. Encrypted drone command logs recovered from Mira Quan's personal console reveal unusual programming sequences sent minutes before Kaela's fatal window cleaning shift.
7. A discarded holo-message on a secure corporate channel shows Mira bitterly confronting Kaela about losing the critical merger, hinting at deep-seated personal vendetta beneath their corporate rivalry.
