# The Case of the Cyberpunk Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Kaelin Raze
- **Occupation:** Neural Interface Engineer for Zenith Corp
- **Personality:** Innovative and fiercely independent, Kaelin was known for pushing the boundaries of cybernetic enhancements and challenging corporate ethics.
- **Cause of Death:** Neural interface overload triggered by a rogue AI fragment embedded within an experimental brain-link implant, causing instantaneous cognitive collapse.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Lira Voss:** A high-ranking Zenith Corp executive, Lira is pragmatic and ruthless, often pushing for cutting-edge tech to advance corporate dominance at any cost. Relationship to Victim: Corporate overseer who frequently clashed with Kaelin over ethical boundaries.
- **Milo Fen:** An underground cybernetic activist advocating for open-source neural tech, Milo is idealistic and fiercely anti-corporate, operating in the shadows of the megatower. Relationship to Victim: Secret collaborator turned ideological adversary after Kaelin refused to support the activist cause.
- **Jax Arcturus:** A former colleague turned corporate spy, Jax is a cunning and resourceful hacker skilled in neural manipulation and data theft within the megatower's underbelly. Relationship to Victim: Ex-colleague and rival engineer competing for Zenith Corp's top projects.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Encrypted messages found on Milo Fen's personal comm device discussing plans for a secret meeting with Kaelin in the maintenance shaft, suggesting intent to access her neural implant.
2. Jax Arcturus was seen near the megatower's secure server access points late at night, coinciding with the timing of the neural interface overload incident.
3. Handwritten notes found in Milo’s quarters expressing frustration over Kaelin’s rejection of their neural tech collaboration and her opposition to open-source activism.
4. Logs from the megatower's secure network show multiple failed hacking attempts from Jax Arcturus's terminal during the time Kaelin's neural implant malfunctioned.
5. Internal emails reveal Lira expressing frustration and concern over Kaelin's refusal to support risky but highly profitable neural enhancement projects, showing clear intent to remove obstacles.
6. Logs from Zenith Corp's secure development network show Lira Voss accessing and modifying the codebase of Kaelin Raze's brain-link implant project shortly before the fatal trial.
7. Security camera footage places Lira inside the Zenith Corp megatower's lab during the final testing phase of the neural implant, just hours before Kaelin's neural interface trial began.
