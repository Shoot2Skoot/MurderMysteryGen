# The Case of the Archaeology Team in an Ancient Egyptian Tomb Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Dr. Selim Nadir
- **Occupation:** Chief archaeologist specializing in uncovering and preserving ancient Egyptian burial rituals, driven by a quest to decode lost mythologies.
- **Personality:** Meticulously analytical and deeply respectful of ancient cultures (primary); however, he harbors a reckless obsession with proving controversial theories, often disregarding safety protocols (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Killed by a concealed mechanical collapse triggered as an Environmental Sabotage: the ancient tomb's support beams were tampered with to cause a fatal cave-in designed to mimic an accidental structural failure.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Prof. Marcus Ellery:** A pragmatic engineer specializing in ancient structures, brought in to assess tomb safety (primary); privately skeptical of the supernatural, but hides a gambling debt that threatens his career (hidden). Relationship to Victim: Consultant whose safety recommendations were frequently ignored by Dr. Nadir.
- **Dr. Yasmin Farouk:** An ambitious Egyptologist eager to surpass Dr. Nadir’s legacy (primary); secretly harbors resentment due to being repeatedly overlooked for leadership roles (hidden). Relationship to Victim: Former protégé and rival within the archaeological team.
- **Omar Khalil:** The team's local guide, deeply knowledgeable about regional folklore (primary); secretly involved in illicit antiquities trade, using the expedition for personal gain (hidden). Relationship to Victim: Trusted guide who disagreed with Nadir’s strict preservation ethics.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. A series of meticulous hand-written notes discovered in her personal journal, outlining her dissatisfaction with Dr. Nadir's leadership and plans to introduce her own excavation strategies that would bring her recognition.
2. A series of candid, heated messages recorded on Omar’s encrypted tablet debating preservation boundaries, which challenge Nadir’s policies but stop short of suggesting violent actions.
3. A fragment of a weathered, ancient papyrus scroll found in Dr. Farouk's tent, detailing traditional methods of reinforcing tomb structures, complete with diagrams of wooden beam placement and natural adhesives.
4. A set of worn, smuggler’s gloves with faint traces of modern lubricant found hidden in Omar Khalil’s personal kit, matching the residues on the torn support beam fragments at the collapse site.
5. A slender, almost imperceptible fracture tool fashioned to look like a rare scarab amulet lies concealed within Ellery's personal collection of artifacts, its edges too sharp and precise to be ancient.
6. An unsigned ledger sequestered in Ellery's locked desk details staggering gambling debts alongside ominous remarks about 'stopping the costly fool'—a likely allusion to Dr. Nadir's safety concerns and halted excavations.
7. Fingerprint analysis reveals Ellery's prints on maintenance schematics and structural points in the tomb discovered on-site, implicating his night-time access and knowledge used to plant the device unnoticed.
