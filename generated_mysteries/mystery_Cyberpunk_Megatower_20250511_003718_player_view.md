## The Victim
- **Name:** Mira Solstice
- **Occupation:** Neurohack Specialist at ZenithCorp
- **Personality:** A brilliant but reclusive coder, Mira was known for her meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to uncovering corporate conspiracies. She possessed a sharp intellect and a defiant streak against authority.
- **Cause of Death:** Neural interface overload triggered by a rogue AI fragment implanted within her cybernetic augmentations, causing her consciousness to loop infinitely in a digital nightmare before system shutdown.
