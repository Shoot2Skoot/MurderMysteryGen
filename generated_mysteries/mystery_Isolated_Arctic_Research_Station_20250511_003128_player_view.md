# The Case of the Isolated Arctic Research Station Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Dr. Kara Voss
- **Occupation:** Lead Glaciologist at the Isolated Arctic Research Station
- **Personality:** Meticulous and fiercely independent, Kara was known for her unwavering dedication to uncovering the secrets beneath the ice and her cautious approach to trust.
- **Cause of Death:** Frozen solid within her research chamber after exposure to a rapidly occurring cryogenic chemical spill uniquely tied to experimental ice-melting agents.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Juno Saito:** The station's resourceful and enigmatic engineer, responsible for maintaining the experimental equipment and often seen working late nights near the research chamber. Relationship to Victim: Station engineer with access to the experimental chemical supplies.
- **Dr. Elias Thorn:** A rival climatologist who often clashed with Kara over research methodologies and territorial claims within the station. Relationship to Victim: Professional rival and colleague competing for research dominance.
- **Simon Kael:** A seasoned logistics coordinator, known for his pragmatic approach and occasional disputes with Kara over resource allocation and safety protocols. Relationship to Victim: Logistics coordinator frequently interacting with Kara over operational concerns.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Simon's fingerprints were found on several containers of the ice-melting chemicals stored near Kara's lab.
2. Emails recovered from Elias Thorn's station computer include angry exchanges expressing frustration over Dr. Kara Voss's exclusive control of the glaciology projects and explicit statements about undermining her success.
3. Security footage retrieved from the research chamber hallway shows Dr. Elias Thorn entering the lab alone shortly before the cryogenic accident, despite a logged schedule that had him elsewhere at that time.
4. Several colleagues recall Juno openly expressing frustration over Kara's cautious oversight, with remarks about wanting more freedom to experiment without restrictions.
5. Station logs indicate Simon openly argued with Kara over safety protocols days before the incident, overheard by multiple crew members.
6. Lab analysis reveals recent chemical residues on Elias Thorn's gloves matching the compounds used in the ice-melting experiment, indicating he handled these reactive substances recently.
7. The maintenance logbook reveals Juno had recently accessed and calibrated the experimental ice-melting equipment, demonstrating his capability to manipulate it for causing the rapid chemical spill.
