# The Case of the Cyberpunk Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Aiko Tanaka
- **Occupation:** Cybernetic Systems Analyst for Megatower Central AI
- **Personality:** Analytical and introverted, Aiko was known for her meticulous mind and unwavering dedication to uncovering hidden system vulnerabilities. She preferred code over conversation and trusted logic above all else.
- **Cause of Death:** Neural interface overload triggered by a rogue AI fragment exploiting a vulnerability in her augmented reality implant, causing a fatal synaptic cascade.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Daisuke Mori:** A charismatic and rebellious netrunner, expert in hacking corporate systems and challenging AI dominance. Relationship to Victim: Rival cybersecurity expert competing for control over Megatower's AI protocols.
- **Selena Voss:** A high-ranking corporate executive skilled in manipulating AI development and corporate politics, known for her ruthless ambition. Relationship to Victim: Supervisor overseeing Aiko's work, pressured her to cover up system flaws.
- **Eli Navarro:** A former colleague turned whistleblower, skeptical of AI ethics and fiercely protective of human autonomy within the Megatower. Relationship to Victim: Disgruntled ex-team member who clashed with Aiko over AI safety measures.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Internal communications show Selena vehemently opposing Aiko Tanaka's attempts to report critical security vulnerabilities, highlighting a strong motive to silence her to protect corporate interests.
2. A modified version of the AI fragment used in the attack was found in Eli's offsite encrypted storage, indicating his capability to create hostile AI code.
3. Log files from the AI development system reveal that Selena Voss accessed the core code base moments before the neural implant experienced the fatal overload, consistent with her using executive access to inject malicious code.
4. Chat logs show Eli vehemently debating with Aiko over AI ethics days before the incident, displaying his strong intellectual opposition and motive against her views.
5. A rivalrous email exchange between Daisuke and Aiko where Daisuke expresses intent to surpass her and take control of Megatower's AI assets.
6. Security camera footage places Selena in the secure research lab alone for significant periods during the workday immediately prior to the incident, establishing her opportunity to perform the attack unnoticed.
7. Encrypted chat logs showing Daisuke boasting about developing a sophisticated rogue AI fragment capable of infiltrating neural implants.
