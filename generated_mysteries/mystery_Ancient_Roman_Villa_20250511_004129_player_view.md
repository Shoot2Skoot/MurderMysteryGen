- **Occupation:** Wealthy landowner and patron of the arts
- **Personality:** Proud and authoritative, yet cultured and cunning, Lucius was known for his sharp intellect and love of philosophical debates hosted in his villa.
- **Cause of Death:** Succumbed to a rare allergic reaction triggered by inhalation of crushed mandrake root powder, deliberately released through the hidden vents of his private bath chamber’s hypocaust system.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Aurelia Cornelia:** A sharp-witted and ambitious patroness of the arts, Aurelia was a frequent guest at Lucius's villa and envied his influence in Roman high society. Relationship to Victim: Social rival competing for influence among elite patrons.
- **Servius Flaccus:** Lucius's long-serving and secretive steward, Servius is known for his loyalty yet has been seen acting furtively in the villa lately. Relationship to Victim: Steward managing the estate and privy to household secrets.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Records and correspondences reveal Servius privately expressed deep frustration and veiled threats about Lucius’s domineering control over the estate, indicating a strong personal motive to remove him.
2. Several guests observed Aurelia engaging socially in the central hall throughout the evening, but a distorted rumor suggested she might have accessed less visible parts of the villa unnoticed, implying potential knowledge of the hypocaust system.
3. Fragments of crushed mandrake root powder were found in Gaius Tullius Marcellus's private belongings, indicating his knowledge and potential acquisition of the rare allergen used in the poisoning.
4. Records and witnesses confirm Gaius's longstanding bitter land dispute with Lucius Septimius Varro, demonstrating strong motive tied to reclaiming family property and settling their rivalry.
5. Aurelia was known to covet Lucius's influence in artistic patronage, and a private letter was found expressing jealousy and desire to outshine him in Roman elite circles.
6. Traces of crushed mandrake root powder were discovered in the secret vents of the hypocaust system beneath Lucius's private bath chamber, matching the known allergen that caused Lucius's fatal reaction.
7. Witnesses confirm Servius was alone near the bath chamber during Lucius’s bathing ritual, providing the opportunity to manipulate the hypocaust system and release the toxin without interruption.
