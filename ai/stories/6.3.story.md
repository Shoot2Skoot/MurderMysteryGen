# Story 6.3: Integrate Generated Names into `CaseInitializationAgent`

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to modify `CaseInitializationAgent` to use the dynamically generated thematic name lists for creating the victim's name.

**Context:** Building on Story 6.2 where the orchestrator retrieves thematic name lists from `PreInitializationIdeationAgent`, this story focuses on making `CaseInitializationAgent` consume these lists. Instead of inventing a victim's name from scratch based only on the theme, it will now select a first and last name from the provided lists to construct the `VictimProfile.name`.

## Detailed Requirements

- Modify `src/mystery_ai/agents/case_initializer.py`.
- Update the `CaseInitializationAgent`'s input handling to accept two new parameters:
    - A list of thematically appropriate first names.
    - A list of thematically appropriate last names.
    (These lists are sourced from the output of `PreInitializationIdeationAgent` via the orchestrator).
- Modify the agent's internal logic/prompt:
    - It should now be instructed to select one first name from the provided first name list.
    - It should select one last name from the provided last name list.
    - These selected names should be combined to form the `VictimProfile.name`.
- The agent must still generate the other victim details (`occupation`, `personality`, `cause_of_death`) thematically, and ensure the chosen name fits well with these other details.
- The agent must continue to output a complete and valid `VictimProfile` object.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `CaseInitializationAgent` correctly processes new input parameters for the list of first names and the list of last names.
- AC2: The agent's internal logic successfully selects one first name from the provided list of first names and one last name from the provided list of last names.
- AC3: The `VictimProfile.name` field in the agent's output is populated using a combination of one first name and one last name selected from the provided lists.
- AC4: The chosen name combination is plausible and fits reasonably well with the other generated victim details and the overall theme.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: None.
  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/mystery_ai/agents/case_initializer.py` (primarily agent instructions/prompt).

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Python.
  - LLM Prompt Engineering.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Modifying existing agent instructions.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - N/A

- **Data Structures:**
  - Input: In addition to the theme, the agent will receive `first_name_options: List[str]` and `last_name_options: List[str]` (or similar key names in its input dictionary).
  - Output: `VictimProfile` Pydantic model instance.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - None specific to this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - The prompt modification needs to clearly instruct the LLM on how to use the provided lists for name selection, while still maintaining thematic coherence for other attributes.
  - Ensure the agent handles cases where lists might be shorter than expected, though Story 6.1 aims for N=50.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Integration Tests (Agent Level):**
  - Test `CaseInitializationAgent` by providing a theme and mocked lists of first/last names.
  - Verify the output `VictimProfile.name` uses names from the provided lists.
  - Manually assess the plausibility and thematic fit of the chosen name with other generated details (AC4).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Run the main orchestration (`python -m src.mystery_ai.main --theme "Your Theme"`) which now includes the full flow up to this point.
  - Inspect the `VictimProfile.name` in the final JSON output.
  - Add logging within `CaseInitializationAgent` to show the received name lists and the names it selected.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Update `CASE_INITIALIZER_INSTRUCTIONS` in `src/mystery_ai/agents/case_initializer.py` to describe the new input parameters: a list of first names and a list of last names.
- [ ] Task 2: Modify the prompt to instruct the LLM to select one first name from the provided list of first names.
- [ ] Task 3: Modify the prompt to instruct the LLM to select one last name from the provided list of last names.
- [ ] Task 4: Instruct the LLM to use these selected names to populate the `VictimProfile.name` field.
- [ ] Task 5: Ensure the prompt still guides the LLM to generate other victim details (`occupation`, `personality`, `cause_of_death`) thematically and coherently with the chosen name.
- [ ] Task 6: Add logging within the agent to record the received name lists and the specific names selected.
- [ ] Task 7: Test with various themes and example name lists to ensure correct name selection and overall profile coherence.
- [ ] Task 8: Verify all Acceptance Criteria are met.
