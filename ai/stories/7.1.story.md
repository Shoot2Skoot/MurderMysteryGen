# Story 7.1: Define Master List of Evidence Categories

**Status:** COMPLETED

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to define a master list of diverse Evidence Categories/Types so that the system can generate a wider variety of evidence items.

**Context:** This is the first story in Epic 7, which aims to make individual evidence items richer and more varied. This story focuses on creating a foundational master list of different types or categories of evidence (e.g., "Letter," "Financial Record," "Witness Statement"). This list will be used by the `EvidenceGenerationAgent` in later stories (via the orchestrator) to ensure a broader spectrum of evidence types is considered during generation.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create an easily editable file for the master list of evidence categories. This will be:
    - A JSON file named `evidence_categories.json` in `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/`.
- Populate this file with an initial set of at least 10-15 diverse and commonly found evidence types/categories relevant to murder mysteries. Examples include: "Personal Correspondence," "Official Document," "Financial Record," "Physical Object Description," "Witness Testimony Snippet," "Digital Footprint," "News Clipping," "Forensic Report Snippet."
- Ensure the chosen format and location allow the list to be easily loaded by `main_orchestrator.py` (which will be implemented in Story 7.4).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A JSON master list file for Evidence Categories named `evidence_categories.json` exists in `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/`.
- AC2: The master list contains at least 10 distinct and relevant evidence categories suitable for generating varied evidence in a mystery.
- AC3: The structure of the list (e.g., Python list of strings, JSON array of strings) is such that it can be programmatically loaded by the orchestrator in a subsequent story.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/evidence_categories.json`
  - Files to Modify: None in this story (orchestrator loading is Story 7.4).

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Python (if using Python list/enum).
  - JSON (if using JSON file).

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - N/A

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - N/A

- **Data Structures:**
  - The list itself, e.g., `EVIDENCE_CATEGORIES = ["Personal Correspondence", "Financial Record", ...]`

- **Environment Variables:**
  - None.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - Choose a clear and maintainable naming convention for the list and its items.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - If defined as a Python module, a simple test to import it and check the list length/type.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Manually inspect the created file to confirm it exists, contains at least 10-15 diverse categories, and is correctly formatted (AC1, AC2).
  - Conceptually verify its loadability (AC3) â€“ the actual loading test is for Story 7.4.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Decide on the format and specific file path for the evidence categories master list (Decision: `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/evidence_categories.json`).
- [ ] Task 2: Create the chosen file.
- [ ] Task 3: Research and define at least 10-15 diverse evidence categories suitable for murder mysteries.
    - Examples: "Personal Letter/Diary Entry", "Email/Text Message Log", "Financial Statement/Ledger", "Official Report (Police, Coroner)", "Physical Object (Weapon, Clothing Fiber)", "Witness Testimony Snippet", "Security Camera Footage Description", "News Article/Clipping", "Forensic Analysis Result (DNA, Fingerprints)", "Digital Evidence (Browser History, File System)", "Voicemail Transcript", "Photograph", "Map/Blueprint".
- [ ] Task 4: Populate the file with these defined categories in the chosen format (Python list or JSON array).
- [ ] Task 5: Review the list for diversity and relevance.
- [ ] Task 6: Verify all Acceptance Criteria are met.

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `<Agent Model Name/Version>`
- **Completion Notes:** JSON file `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/evidence_categories.json` created with 15 diverse evidence categories. Orchestrator updated to load this list.
- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft
  - Marked as COMPLETED.
