# Story 5.1: Define and Store Master Attribute Lists

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to define and store master lists for Cause of Death, Motive Categories, Occupation Archetypes, and Personality Archetypes so they can be used by the generation system.

**Context:** This is the first story for Epic 5: Static List Integration for Core Attributes. Its purpose is to create the foundational data (master lists) that will be used by subsequent stories in this epic to inject diversity into victim and suspect profiles. This story directly enables Story 5.2 (Orchestrator - Attribute Sub-list Selection) by providing the lists to be loaded and sampled.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create easily editable files (e.g., JSON or Python lists/enums in `src/mystery_ai/core/` or `src/mystery_ai/config/`) for each master list.
- Populate with initial sets of diverse options (Cause of Death list is user-provided; others to be defined).
- Ensure these lists can be loaded by the orchestrator.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Master list file/module exists for Cause of Death.
- AC2: Master list file/module exists for Motive Categories (min 5 diverse categories).
- AC3: Master list file/module exists for Occupation Archetypes (min 10 diverse archetypes).
- AC4: Master list file/module exists for Personality Archetypes (min 10 diverse archetypes).
- AC5: Orchestrator includes placeholder logic to load these lists (actual loading can be part of story 5.2).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `src/mystery_ai/core/master_lists/cause_of_death.py` (or `.json`)
    - `src/mystery_ai/core/master_lists/motive_categories.py` (or `.json`)
    - `src/mystery_ai/core/master_lists/occupation_archetypes.py` (or `.json`)
    - `src/mystery_ai/core/master_lists/personality_archetypes.py` (or `.json`)
    (Assuming a new subdirectory `master_lists` within `src/mystery_ai/core/` for organization, or alternatively, directly in `src/mystery_ai/config/` if preferred by project structure.)
  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/mystery_ai/main_orchestrator.py` (for placeholder loading logic as per AC5)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Python (for `.py` lists/enums)
  - JSON (if chosen as the file format)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - None directly for defining these lists. Orchestrator will handle loading.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - N/A

- **Data Structures:**
  - The master lists themselves will be Python `List[str]` or enums, or JSON arrays of strings.
    - Example (Python List): `CAUSE_OF_DEATH_LIST = ["Poisoning", "Stabbing", ...]`
    - Example (JSON): `{ "causes_of_death": ["Poisoning", "Stabbing", ...] }`

- **Environment Variables:**
  - None specific to this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
  - If using Python files for lists, ensure they are easily importable.
  - If using JSON, ensure it's well-formed.
  - For placeholder loading logic in AC5, ensure it's clearly marked as a placeholder to be fully implemented in Story 5.2.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - For AC5: A simple unit test could check if the orchestrator module can be imported without error after adding placeholder loading logic. (Full loading tests will be part of Story 5.2).
- **Integration Tests:**
  - N/A for this story directly, more relevant for Story 5.2.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify the existence and content of the created master list files (AC1-AC4).
  - Manually inspect the placeholder loading logic in the orchestrator (AC5).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Decide on the format for master lists (Python lists/enums vs. JSON files).
  - **Decision:** JSON files will be used for master lists.
  - **Location:** Files will be stored in a new directory: `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: If JSON, define the schema for each file.
    - **Schema:** Each JSON file will contain a single key (e.g., "causes_of_death", "motive_categories") whose value is an array of strings. Example: `{ "causes_of_death": ["Item1", "Item2"] }`.
- [x] Task 2: Create the `cause_of_death` master list file.
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Populate with the user-provided list (ensure this list is obtained).
- [x] Task 3: Create the `motive_categories` master list file.
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Populate with at least 5 diverse motive categories (e.g., Revenge, Financial Gain, Passion, Fear, Ideology).
    - **List created:** ["Revenge", "Financial Gain", "Jealousy/Passion", "Fear/Self-preservation", "Ideological Differences", "Accidental/Manslaughter", "Cover-up (silencing a witness/preventing exposure)"]
- [x] Task 4: Create the `occupation_archetypes` master list file.
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Populate with at least 10 diverse generic occupation archetypes (e.g., Executive, Laborer, Artisan, Scholar, Performer, Service Worker, Unemployed, Retired).
    - **List created:** ["Executive/Manager", "Business Owner", "Office Worker/Clerk", "Manual Laborer/Tradesperson", "Artist/Musician/Writer", "Scientist/Researcher/Scholar", "Healthcare Professional (Doctor, Nurse)", "Service Industry Worker (Waiter, Bartender, Cashier)", "Law Enforcement/Security", "Homemaker/Stay-at-home Parent", "Student", "Unemployed", "Retired", "Politician/Public Figure", "Educator/Teacher"]
- [x] Task 5: Create the `personality_archetypes` master list file.
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Populate with at least 10 diverse personality archetypes/core traits (e.g., Ambitious, Greedy, Resentful, Fearful, Idealistic, Deceptive, Loyal, Introverted, Extroverted).
    - **List created:** ["Ambitious", "Greedy/Materialistic", "Resentful/Bitter", "Fearful/Anxious", "Idealistic/Optimistic", "Deceptive/Manipulative", "Loyal/Trustworthy", "Introverted/Reserved", "Extroverted/Outgoing", "Cynical/Pessimistic", "Naive/Gullible", "Impulsive/Reckless", "Meticulous/Obsessive", "Kind/Compassionate", "Arrogant/Egotistical"]
- [x] Task 6: Implement placeholder loading logic in `src/mystery_ai/main_orchestrator.py` for all created lists.
  - [x] Subtask 6.1: Ensure the placeholder clearly indicates that full implementation is for Story 5.2.
    - **Note:** Placeholders added to `src/mystery_ai/orchestration/main_orchestrator.py`.
- [x] Task 7: Verify all Acceptance Criteria are met.
  - AC1: `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/cause_of_death.json` created. (Verified)
  - AC2: `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/motive_categories.json` created with 7 categories. (Verified)
  - AC3: `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/occupation_archetypes.json` created with 15 archetypes. (Verified)
  - AC4: `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/personality_archetypes.json` created with 15 archetypes. (Verified)
  - AC5: Placeholder comments added to `src/mystery_ai/orchestration/main_orchestrator.py`. (Verified)

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)`
- **Completion Notes:** All master lists created as JSON files in `MurderMysteryGen/config/master_lists/`. Placeholder comments for loading these lists have been added to `src/mystery_ai/orchestration/main_orchestrator.py`. Files created: `config/master_lists/cause_of_death.json`, `config/master_lists/motive_categories.json`, `config/master_lists/occupation_archetypes.json`, `config/master_lists/personality_archetypes.json` (relative to MurderMysteryGen root).
- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft
  - Populated tasks and marked story for review.
