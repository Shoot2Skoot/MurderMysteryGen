# The Case of the Isolated Arctic Research Station Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Dr. Elena Korsakov
- **Occupation:** Lead Glaciologist at the Isolated Arctic Research Station
- **Personality:** Meticulous and highly driven, Elena is known for her relentless pursuit of scientific truth and a tendency to isolate herself emotionally from the team.
- **Cause of Death:** Succumbed to a rare form of hypothermia caused by a sabotaged thermal regulation suit that reversed the heating function, encasing her in lethal ice crystals from within.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Captain Marcus Hale:** The stoic and authoritative leader of the research station, responsible for overall safety but under pressure from funding cuts and logistical challenges. Relationship to Victim: Station commander who disagreed with Elena over mission priorities and protocols.
- **Nina Larsen:** The station's communications officer, resourceful and secretive, often feeling overshadowed by the scientific staff's importance. Relationship to Victim: Station colleague frustrated by Elena's dismissive attitude toward non-scientific roles.
- **Dr. Viktor Petrov:** A fellow glaciologist and former mentor to Elena, pragmatic yet harboring resentment over a scientific rivalry that soured their relationship. Relationship to Victim: Professional rival and ex-mentor who clashed over research findings.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. A partially melted ice crystal sample found clutched in Nina Larsen's gloved hand, suggesting she was present near Elena during her final moments in the cold environment.
2. Several personal research notes were discovered in Viktor Petrov's quarters that criticize Dr. Elena Korsakov's work and express frustration over his demotion.
3. Security logs show Nina accessing the equipment room late at night, coinciding with the timeframe when Elena's thermal suit was reportedly tampered with.
4. A set of fingerprints belonging to Dr. Viktor Petrov was found on the thermal regulation suit's internal heating mechanism during forensic analysis.
5. Forensic analysis of Dr. Korsakov's thermal suit revealed deliberate rewiring that inverted the heating function to emit extreme cold, a tampering only someone with extensive access and technical knowledge could perform.
6. Security camera timestamps show Marcus accessing the maintenance area alone shortly before Dr. Korsakov went on her field expedition, matching the timeframe needed to sabotage the equipment without witnesses.
7. Several recorded disputes between Marcus Hale and Dr. Korsakov were documented in station logs, highlighting intense disagreements over resource allocation and her strict adherence to protocols.
