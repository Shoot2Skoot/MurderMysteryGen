# The Case of the Cyberpunk City Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Kaelen Vox
- **Occupation:** Neuro-interface architect specializing in designing immersive augmented reality experiences for elite corporate clients, secretly covertly embedding illicit code to siphon data for underground factions.
- **Personality:** Charismatic and visionary in public, pioneering new realities with confidence (primary). Privately, Kaelen is deeply paranoid and emotionally detached, haunted by past betrayals that drive reckless risk-taking (hidden/contrasting).
- **Cause of Death:** Succumbed to a fatal cerebral feedback loop caused by a sabotaged neural implant, where corrupted AR code induced a catastrophic digital delirium that irreversibly damaged brain synapses.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Dr. Elion Kade:** An enigmatic neuroscientist obsessed with pushing the boundaries of human cognition, morally ambiguous and emotionally reserved. Relationship to Victim: Kaelenâ€™s former mentor who disapproved of his reckless experimental methods that risked lives.
- **Tessara Vynn:** A ruthless corporate security specialist notorious for aggressive tactics to eliminate threats to her employer, blending cold efficiency with a taste for psychological manipulation. Relationship to Victim: Head of security at a rival tech firm, viewed Kaelen as a dangerous insider leaking secrets.
- **Jax Arlo:** A charismatic leader of an underground hacker collective, advocating for digital freedom but willing to engage in morally ambiguous actions for the cause. Relationship to Victim: Former collaborator and confidante turned adversary after a betrayal over the control of illicit code.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Multiple encrypted messages intercepted between Dr. Kade and insiders show his strong disapproval of Kaelen's experimental practices and emphasize the need to 'put an end' to the dangerous methods to protect ethical standards.
2. Forensic analysis revealed malicious corrupted AR code specifically designed for Kaelen's neural implant was traced back to the neurotechnology labs where Dr. Elion Kade has unrestricted access.
3. Logs from a cyber-security terminal near the event show Tessara's credentials used to remotely access Kaelen's neural implant around the time of his collapse.
4. Surveillance logs indicate Dr. Kade had unsupervised access to Kaelen's implant during a maintenance procedure just hours before Kaelen's death, providing the opportunity to tamper with the device unnoticed.
5. A data log recovered from the AR system shows Jax Arlo's signature embedded in a corrupted code fragment that caused a neural feedback error in Kaelen's implant.
6. Several attendees reported seeing Tessara near Kaelen during the AR launch event, with a portable neural interface device active and connected, implying opportunity for direct interference.
7. Security footage reveals Jax near Kaelen's safehouse during late-night data transfers, lingering suspiciously close to the hacking window period.
