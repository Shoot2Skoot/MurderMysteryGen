# The Case of the Isolated Arctic Research Station Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Dr. Ingrid Halvorsen
- **Occupation:** Lead Glaciologist at the Arctic Research Station
- **Personality:** Meticulous and fiercely independent, Ingrid is known for her unwavering dedication to uncovering climate secrets beneath the ice and her reserved nature that keeps colleagues at a distance.
- **Cause of Death:** Succumbed to hypothermia caused by sudden exposure to a hidden crevasse's freezing brine pool beneath the ice floor, triggered by a sabotaged thermal sensor that masked the danger.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Anna Petrovna:** The station's reserved engineer, skilled in maintaining the complex thermal systems but often feeling overlooked and undervalued by the research team. Relationship to Victim: Thermal systems engineer, held grudges over Ingrid's dismissal of her suggestions.
- **Captain Lars Bjornsson:** The pragmatic leader of the station, responsible for overall station safety, often clashing with Ingrid over field protocols and risk assessments. Relationship to Victim: Station commander who frequently argued with Ingrid over safety measures and scheduling.
- **Dr. Erik Sundvall:** A rival climatologist with a competitive streak, Erik is known for his abrasive demeanor and relentless pursuit to discredit others' research findings. Relationship to Victim: Professional rival competing for the same research grants and recognition.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. A station crew member recalls overhearing Lars express frustration to colleagues regarding Ingrid's risk-taking and its impact on mission timelines shortly before her death.
2. Personal notes found in Anna's quarters included resentful journal entries expressing anger about being undervalued and warnings from Ingrid being ignored, suggesting deep personal grievances.
3. Logs show Captain Lars Bjornsson was alone in the equipment room just hours before Dr. Ingrid's fatal fieldwork, during which the thermal sensor was compromised.
4. Security logs show Sundvall was on duty during the maintenance shift when the thermal sensor was last checked, confirming his opportunity to access and potentially tamper with the equipment unnoticed.
5. Analysis of security logs revealed that Anna was the only one present in the thermal systems room during the unsupervised late shift on the night before Dr. Ingrid Halvorsen's death.
6. Forensic examination of the thermal sensor control panel uncovered traces of a disrupted calibration and unauthorized manual adjustments correlating with Anna's shift times.
7. A set of dirty gloves matching Sundvall's size was found near the sensor equipment room, containing traces of thermal sensor circuitry.
