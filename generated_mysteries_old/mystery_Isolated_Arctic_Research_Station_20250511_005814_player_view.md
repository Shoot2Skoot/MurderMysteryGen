# The Case of the Isolated Arctic Research Station Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Dr. Ingrid Svalen
- **Occupation:** Lead Glaciologist at the Arctic Research Station
- **Personality:** Highly meticulous and fiercely independent, Ingrid was known for her relentless pursuit of data and her quiet resilience in extreme isolation.
- **Cause of Death:** Succumbed to fatal hypothermia caused by a sabotaged experimental thermal suit's micro-heating circuits, which triggered a cascade failure during a severe Arctic storm.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Anya Petrov:** A resourceful and secretive technician specializing in thermal systems, whose loyalty is ambiguous and whose work was critical to maintaining equipment including the victim’s experimental suit. Relationship to Victim: Technician responsible for the maintenance of the victim’s experimental gear.
- **Sgt. Lena Kovac:** The station’s security officer, tough and vigilant, responsible for the safety of all personnel and suspected of harboring resentment towards the scientific team’s perceived negligence regarding station protocols. Relationship to Victim: Security officer overseeing station personnel, clashed with the victim over safety procedures.
- **Dr. Elias Marten:** A pragmatic climatologist with a strained history of professional rivalry with Dr. Svalen, known for his blunt pragmatism and skepticism towards novel methodologies. Relationship to Victim: Colleague and scientific rival competing for research acclaim.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Forensic examination found evidence that the micro-heating circuits in Dr. Svalen's thermal suit were deliberately cut and reconnected improperly, consistent with the tools issued only to the security team, including Sgt. Lena Kovac.
2. Security logs reveal that Sgt. Lena Kovac was the only person to enter the equipment storage room unaccompanied shortly before Dr. Ingrid Svalen's departure for the field expedition.
3. Several colleagues note Anya’s growing frustration with Ingrid’s dismissal of her ideas, and overheard a heated argument between them days before the incident.
4. Security logs reveal that Dr. Marten was seen entering the equipment storage late at night during the Arctic storm when others were confined, placing him at the scene where the suit sabotage occurred.
5. Colleagues report that Dr. Marten expressed frustration about being overshadowed by Dr. Svalen's groundbreaking research, suggesting a strong desire to remove professional competition.
6. Several recorded complaints from Kovac about Dr. Svalen's disregard for station safety protocols were recovered from station logs, including heated exchanges that highlight Kovac's deep resentment and motive to act against the victim.
7. Maintenance logs reveal Anya conducted multiple unsupervised checks on the thermal suit hours before the storm, placing her at the scene with access to the victim's equipment.
