# The Case of the Cyberpunk City Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Kaelin Voss
- **Occupation:** Augmented Reality Architect specializing in immersive, hyper-realistic urban simulations for elite clients.
- **Personality:** Charismatically innovative and socially adept (primary). Underneath, deeply distrustful and secretive about their own past (hidden).
- **Cause of Death:** Asphyxiated by a custom neuro-sync gas released within an augmented reality chamber, designed to target and disrupt the victim’s breathing reflexes by manipulating their sensory input, causing fatal suffocation masked as a hallucination in their final simulation experience.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Lila Chen:** An enigmatic enhancement surgeon specializing in neural implants, admired for her calm professionalism and meticulous care (primary). However, she secretly struggles with guilt over past malpractice that Kaelin threatened to expose (concealed vulnerability). Relationship to Victim: Kaelin's medical provider and occasional confidante, yet burdened by a dark secret that could implicate her in his death.
- **Oren Vask:** A charismatic underground club owner with deep ties to the city's illicit tech markets, sharp-witted and socially influential (primary). Unknown to many, he is also an informant for a corporate security agency, covertly feeding information to maintain his empire (double agent). Relationship to Victim: Had a tense business partnership with Kaelin involving experimental AR tech, marked by unresolved disputes and mutual distrust.
- **Draven Kiro:** A former corporate espionage expert turned rogue hacker, known for his brash confidence and lethal precision (primary). Beneath his rebellious facade, he harbors a hidden agenda tied to a shadowy syndicate that controls parts of the city's AR networks (secret affiliation). Relationship to Victim: A rival AR architect whose projects often conflicted with Kaelin's, fueled by both professional jealousy and past betrayals.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Fragments of a digital log recovered from Kaelin's AR chamber show multiple failed login attempts from Oren Vask's credentials hours before the fatal demonstration. The timestamps hint at deliberate probing of system vulnerabilities.
2. An AR headset recovered from the victim's quarters shows subtle, unauthorized modifications to its internal neuro-sync system — microscopic tubing and an untraceable micro-valve designed to release a fine neurotoxin during usage.
3. Security footage timestamps indicate a brief, unsupervised maintenance slot in the elite AR chamber aligning exactly with the period Draven had authorized infrastructure access, allowing installation of the neuro-sync injector unnoticed.
4. An overheard conversation between employees mentioning Oren boasting about his seamless insider access to the AR chamber’s private controls, portraying him as the sole keyholder capable of manipulating the environment at will.
5. Encrypted logs retrieved from a hidden syndicate server reveal intercepted communications where Draven vehemently argues about Kaelin's exposure of their network, vowing to 'eliminate the threat permanently' to protect their control over AR domains.
6. Witness testimony from a fellow conference attendee recalling a heated private call Lila made the day before the murder, where she expressed grave concerns about Kaelin potentially exposing sensitive information about her past errors.
7. A series of encrypted messages found on Kaelin's personal server show Lila repeatedly questioning the safety protocols of the AR chamber's neuro-sync environment, highlighting her intimate knowledge of its vulnerabilities.
