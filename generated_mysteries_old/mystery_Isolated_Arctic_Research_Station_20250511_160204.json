    "name": "Dr. Lena Vostrikov",
    "occupation": "Glaciologist specializing in subglacial microbial ecosystems, who recently discovered potentially groundbreaking life forms beneath the ice. This puts her at risk due to the controversial nature of exposing unknown biological threats and valuable scientific secrets.",
    "personality": "Highly analytical and methodical in her scientific approach (primary). Beneath this, she struggles with an obsessive need for validation and approval from her peers, driving her to take risky shortcuts and conceal setbacks (hidden/contrasting).",
    "cause_of_death": "Death by acute biotoxin poisoning caused by accidental exposure to a previously unknown, potent neurotoxin released from the thawing ice around a subglacial microbial colony she was studying; the toxin caused rapid paralysis and respiratory failure, leaving limited external evidence but a clear biochemical signature detectable through specialized autopsy."

        "name": "Dr. Erik Halvorsen",
        "description": "The station's senior geologist, pragmatic and stoic in his scientific rigor (primary). Privately, he harbors deep skepticism about the microbial research, fearing it endangers the team and the entire mission, which he has voiced only in confidential reports (quiet opposition).",
        "relationship_to_victim": "Colleague often at odds with Dr. Vostrikov over the risks posed by her research; reluctant collaborator forced into partnership by station command."

      "original_mmo": {
        "means": "Dr. Halvorsen covertly tampered with the containment protocols and environmental filters around the subglacial microbial samples that Dr. Vostrikov was examining, discreetly allowing a precise dose of the neurotoxin to escape into her immediate workspace through the station's ventilation system. He exploited his intimate knowledge of the station's geological layout and atmospheric controls to orchestrate a subtle, toxin dispersion that mimicked an accidental exposure.",
        "motive": "Though publicly committed to scientific integrity, Dr. Halvorsen privately feared that Dr. Vostrikov's research not only threatened the station's safety but could unleash unknown biological hazards beyond containment, potentially dooming the mission and everyone aboard. His intense pragmatic caution, coupled with frustration over being forced into collaboration, drove him to see silencing her as the only way to prevent disaster and protect the greater good.",
        "opportunity": "Dr. Halvorsen had exclusive access to the environmental control systems during scheduled maintenance shifts, a time when only essential personnel were present in the subglacial laboratory module. This window gave him both the privacy and technical opportunity needed to subtly alter containment without raising immediate suspicion, using his specialized understanding of the station's geological and ventilation systems."

          "modified_element_description": "Although Dr. Halvorsen was assigned to maintenance shifts, station logs and biometric records confirm that an unexpected emergency diverted him to assist with a critical system failure in another module during the exact times the environmental controls in the subglacial lab were altered, removing any opportunity to tamper with the ventilation system unnoticed.",
          "reason_for_modification": "Verified presence elsewhere during the critical window negates his chance to manipulate the environmental systems, weakening his opportunity."

        "motive": "Fearing that Dr. Vostrikov's groundbreaking discoveries would jeopardize lucrative proprietary claims held by the corporation Nina clandestinely represents, and concerned the release of such unknown biological information could invite uncontrollable scrutiny, Nina sought to suppress the findings to protect both corporate interests and prevent potential chaos, driven by a conflicted loyalty to her covert handlers and her isolated team.",
        "opportunity": "During the long polar night, when station personnel were preoccupied with an intense storm cutting off external contact, Nina leveraged interruptions to power and communications she orchestrated under the guise of maintenance to infiltrate the secure lab without witnesses, timing her actions precisely when Dr. Vostrikov was away conducting fieldwork on the ice outside the station."
