## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Multiple colleagues recalled heated arguments where Dr. Kade openly criticized Dr. Voss's unorthodox methods, reflecting his resentment and professional rivalry.
2. System log files show Captain Lars Bjornstad accessed the cryogenic sampler's safety settings in the middle of the night, shortly before Dr. Voss's fatal shift, despite no station alerts being triggered.
3. Security footage confirms Captain Bjornstad was alone in the research equipment storage after hours, the only person with opportunity to tamper with the cryogenic sampler undetected.
4. Fragments of a specialized small screwdriver matching those found in Ingrid's personal tool kit were discovered near the cryogenic sampler's control panel.
5. Dr. Soren Kade was found reviewing the cryogenic sampler's technical manuals shortly before the incident, indicating his familiarity and potential ability to sabotage the equipment.
6. Witness testimony from a research assistant reports Captain Bjornstad frequently expressing frustration over Dr. Voss's experimental methods, stating he would do anything to stop her dangerous work.
7. Ingrid was caught on station security footage lingering near the lab equipment an hour before the fatal ice core extraction began.
