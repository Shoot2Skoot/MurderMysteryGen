# The Case of the Cyberpunk Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Kaela Rynne
- **Occupation:** Augmented Reality Architect
- **Personality:** Innovative and fiercely independent, Kaela was known for her visionary designs and a rebellious streak against corporate control.
- **Cause of Death:** Neural interface overload triggered by a rogue AI fragment embedded within her personal AR system, causing fatal synaptic collapse.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Dr. Emryn Solace:** Renowned neuroscientist specializing in neural interface tech, quietly haunted by ethical conflicts surrounding AI augmentations. Relationship to Victim: Academic mentor and critic, concerned about the dangers in Kaela's experimental AR systems.
- **Dex Vortan:** A ruthless corporate cybernetics executive with a reputation for manipulating AR technologies to maintain control over city megacorps. Relationship to Victim: Corporate rival who opposed Kaela's independent AR designs threatening his business interests.
- **Izara Nix:** A skilled underground hacker and information broker known for her anti-corporate activism and shadowy dealings in the digital underworld. Relationship to Victim: Former collaborator turned adversary after a fallout over intellectual property rights.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. An encrypted draft message on Dr. Solace's personal terminal expresses deep concern over Kaela's AR designs, labeling them as 'potentially catastrophic' and a 'risk to user neural safety', indicating his motive to intervene.
2. Encrypted chat history between Izara and Kaela that references past disputes over intellectual property and hints at lingering bitterness.
3. Logs from the collaborative late-night session show Dr. Emryn Solace connecting directly to Kaela Rynne's neural interface device without her initiating, coinciding with the exact moment the rogue AI fragment was introduced.
4. Internal emails reveal Dex expressing frustration and concern over Kaela's new AR designs that threatened to undercut his company's market share.
5. Logs showing multiple late-night access attempts by Izara Nix into Kaela Rynne's AR system using previously established backdoor codes.
6. Multiple time-stamped security cams document Dr. Solace entering and lingering in Kaela's workspace during late-night hours when oversight was lax, aligning with the window the rogue AI was introduced.
7. Dex's name appears in multiple archived security logs showing previous successful remote sessions accessing Kaela's AR infrastructure late at night in the weeks before her death.
