    "name": "Aya Takahashi",
    "occupation": "Neural Interface Architect—a cutting-edge cybernetics engineer who designs experimental mind-linking hardware to connect human consciousness directly with city infrastructure. (This role often places her in entanglements with rival corporations and underground hackers, making her a prime target for sabotage or corporate espionage.)",
    "personality": "Exudes confident innovation and tech-savviness in public, pushing boundaries relentlessly (primary). Yet privately struggles with dissociative episodes and an obsessive fear of losing her own identity to the digital network she helps create, creating deep personal conflicts that might make her vulnerable to manipulation or desperate decisions (hidden/contrasting).",
    "cause_of_death": "Perished due to an advanced neural feedback loop induced by a sabotaged prototype interface device, which forced her brain into a fatal state of hyper-synchronization with conflicting digital signals—effectively causing a neural cascade failure that left no external physical trauma but scrambled her synapses irreversibly."
