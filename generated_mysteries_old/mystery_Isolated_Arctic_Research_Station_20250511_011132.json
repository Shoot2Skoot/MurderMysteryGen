    "name": "Dr. Elara Fenwick",
    "occupation": "Polar Ethnobotanist studying rare Arctic flora and their potential medicinal properties; her work often puts her at odds with corporate interests eager to exploit the region's natural resources. (Her unique knowledge and defiance of profiteers make her a prime target for sabotage or silencing.)",
    "personality": "Scientifically methodical and stoic in her fieldwork, projecting calm under extreme conditions (primary). Beneath this exterior, she battles intense claustrophobia and an overwhelming fear of abandonment, which occasionally leads to erratic decisions (hidden/contrasting). This inner turmoil could be crucial in understanding her final actions and the mystery surrounding her death.",
    "cause_of_death": "Succumbed to a rare and lethal neuroparasitic infection transmitted through an experimental Arctic moss sample she was studying; the parasite infiltrated her nervous system, causing rapid paralysis and mimicking a natural death from hypothermia, cleverly obscuring the true cause until advanced toxicological analysis revealed the biological weapon hidden in the moss."

      "original_mmo": {
        "means": "Dr. Holt deliberately contaminated the experimental Arctic moss samples with a neuroparasitic agent engineered to infect only those handling them closely; by tampering with Fenwick's research materials, he ensured she contracted the lethal infection without immediate suspicion.",
        "motive": "Holt aimed to silence Dr. Fenwick because her findings threatened to halt his company's plans for resource exploitation in the Arctic; eliminating her would remove the main obstacle to the profitable extraction operations.",
        "opportunity": "As the corporate overseer at the isolated research station, Holt had unrestricted access to Fenwick's lab and research materials and ample privacy to introduce the contaminated samples during routine checks, especially when others were occupied with fieldwork or emergencies."
