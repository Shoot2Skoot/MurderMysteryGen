## The Victim
- **Name:** Kaela Vex
- **Occupation:** Data Broker and Neon Syndicate Liaison
- **Personality:** Sharp-witted and fiercely independent, Kaela navigates the neon-lit underworld with a blend of charm and ruthless pragmatism, always staying several hacks ahead of her rivals.
- **Cause of Death:** Electro-magnetic pulse induced neural meltdown triggered by a targeted hacking attack that scrambled her cybernetic implants.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Jax Rendar:** A grizzled ex-corporate enforcer turned mercenary hacker, known for his brutal efficiency and distrust of all data brokers. Relationship to Victim: Former protector whose loyalty soured after a failed job involving Kaela's data deals.
- **Dr. Elias Vox:** A reclusive cybernetics engineer rumored to dabble in illegal implant modifications, haunted by a mysterious past. Relationship to Victim: Supplier of Kaela's cybernetic enhancements and known to hold grudges when betrayed.
- **Mira Solis:** A charismatic and cunning rival data broker with a network stretching across the lower sectors, always eager to expand her influence. Relationship to Victim: Professional rival competing for control over lucrative Neon Syndicate contracts.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Intercepted encrypted messages between Mira Solis and syndicate insiders reveal plans to remove Kaela as a data brokerage competitor and take over her Neon Syndicate contracts.
2. Security logs from the lower sectors show an unauthorized remote access attempt coinciding with Kaela Vex's last data node session, traced back to network ports typically used by Mira Solis's hacker alias.
3. Logs of intercepted communications show Jax Rendar accessing Kaela's cybernetic implant network remotely hours before her death.
4. Security footage captures Jax Rendar entering Kaela's secure location disguised as a maintenance technician shortly before the incident.
5. Network time stamps confirm Mira's digital presence at the exact moment Kaela accessed the shared data node, exploiting a known security loophole to launch a remote EMP virus undetected.
6. Encrypted logs recovered from Dr. Elias Vox's personal terminal show multiple attempts to access Kaela Vex's implant system diagnostics despite security warnings.
7. A digital journal entry by Dr. Elias Vox reveals his frustration and bitterness after Kaela exposed his unauthorized cybernetic modifications to the public.
