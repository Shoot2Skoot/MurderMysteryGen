        "motive": "Jin-Soo's resentment toward Kaelen stemmed not just from being manipulated in their illicit dealings, but from a fractured sense of identity exacerbated by his dissociative symptoms; eliminating Kaelen was a twisted way to reclaim agency over his fractured self and dismantle the suffocating control Kaelen exerted over their shared black market.",
        "opportunity": "Jin-Soo had exclusive access to Kaelen during a private augmentation session in the Megatower's underground cyber-lab, where only the two interfaced directly, providing the perfect window to implant the fatal upgrade undetected amidst legitimate cybernetic enhancements."
