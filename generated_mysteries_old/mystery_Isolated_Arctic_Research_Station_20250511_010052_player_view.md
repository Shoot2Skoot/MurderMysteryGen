# The Case of the Isolated Arctic Research Station Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Dr. Ingrid Halvorsen
- **Occupation:** Lead Glaciologist at the Northwind Arctic Research Station
- **Personality:** Methodical and fiercely independent, Ingrid is deeply passionate about climate study but often keeps her discoveries close, wary of outside interference.
- **Cause of Death:** Succumbed to rapid onset cerebral hypothermia caused by exposure to sublimated dry ice vapors deliberately released inside her insulated sleeping quarters.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Dr. Erik Lundqvist:** A pragmatic and ambitious meteorologist stationed at Northwind, often clashing with Ingrid over research priorities and data sharing. Relationship to Victim: Colleague and scientific rival
- **Marko Petrov:** A stoic field technician with a mysterious past, responsible for maintaining station equipment and access to dangerous materials like dry ice. Relationship to Victim: Technical support staff with access to Ingrid's quarters
- **Sophie Kramer:** The station's supply coordinator, quietly observant and known for her resourcefulness in the harsh environment, but also harboring resentment for strict station protocols. Relationship to Victim: Logistics coordinator who frequently disputed Ingrid's requests

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Station communication logs reveal Sophie raising safety concerns about the sleeping quarters, including warnings about ventilation issues potentially harmful to occupants.
2. Recordings from a meeting where Sophie clearly disputed supply allocations with Ingrid, expressing frustration over limited resources and control.
3. A container with traces of dry ice vapors was found near Marko Petrov's workstation, suggesting he had direct access to the dangerous materials used to cause the victim's fatal cerebral hypothermia.
4. Forensic analysis detected abnormal sublimated dry ice vapors concentrated in the air samples taken from Dr. Ingrid Halvorsen's insulated sleeping quarters.
5. Access logs and station surveillance confirm Erik's presence in both the dry ice storage area and Ingrid's sleeping quarters during the isolated winter night when the murder occurred, at times when few others were present.
6. Station logs indicate that Marko was alone in the storage area for an extended period during the long Arctic night shortly before Ingrid's death, providing him the chance to tamper with her quarters unnoticed.
7. Several colleagues witnessed heated disputes and noted Erik's growing frustration over Ingrid's refusal to share critical climate data and cooperate fully with the team.
