# The Case of the Cyberpunk City Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Aya Takahashi
- **Occupation:** Neural Interface Architect—a cutting-edge cybernetics engineer who designs experimental mind-linking hardware to connect human consciousness directly with city infrastructure. (This role often places her in entanglements with rival corporations and underground hackers, making her a prime target for sabotage or corporate espionage.)
- **Personality:** Exudes confident innovation and tech-savviness in public, pushing boundaries relentlessly (primary). Yet privately struggles with dissociative episodes and an obsessive fear of losing her own identity to the digital network she helps create, creating deep personal conflicts that might make her vulnerable to manipulation or desperate decisions (hidden/contrasting).
- **Cause of Death:** Perished due to an advanced neural feedback loop induced by a sabotaged prototype interface device, which forced her brain into a fatal state of hyper-synchronization with conflicting digital signals—effectively causing a neural cascade failure that left no external physical trauma but scrambled her synapses irreversibly.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Rina-Mi Hoshino:** A brilliant but rebellious underground hacker and activist who distrusts corporate control and fights for digital freedom, often clashing with engineers like Aya. Relationship to Victim: Frequent adversary in the cyber underground, opposing Aya's work on city neural infrastructure.
- **Kai Mori:** Aya's close friend and fellow engineer, empathetic yet secretive, rumored to be torn between loyalty and hidden ambitions within their shared high-tech world. Relationship to Victim: Trusted colleague who occasionally collaborated on Aya's experimental neural devices.
- **Dexter Caldron:** A ruthless corporate espionage agent specializing in cybernetic secrets, known for his cold pragmatism and relentless pursuit of technological dominance. Relationship to Victim: Corporate spy from a rival megacorp competing against Aya's projects.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Internal messages intercepted between Dexter and his corporate handlers reveal discussions about the high value of Aya's neural interface and plans to sabotage her work for competitive advantage.
2. Security system logs show repeated but unsuccessful remote hacking attempts from Dexter Caldron's known cyber-network address near the lab's perimeter during the time Aya was testing her prototype.
3. Internal emails show Kai expressing frustration and jealousy over Aya's rising prominence in the company and hinting at a desire to take control of her projects for himself.
4. Encrypted chat logs recovered from an underground forum reveal Rina-Mi discussing fears about corporate control and expressing a strong ideological motive against Aya's neural infrastructure projects.
5. Security footage places Kai inside the lab during the exact time of the prototype testing when Aya was alone, providing him with the perfect opportunity to tamper with the device unnoticed.
6. Logs recovered from the lab's secure server reveal that Kai accessed Aya's prototype neural interface firmware shortly before her fatal test session, making unauthorized code modifications that triggered the deadly neural feedback loop.
7. Security reports note multiple failed hacking attempts on the lab's network originating from IP addresses traced back to Rina-Mi's known proxies shortly before Aya's prototype test session.
