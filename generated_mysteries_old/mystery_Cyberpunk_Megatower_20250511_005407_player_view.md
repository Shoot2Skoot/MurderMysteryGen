# The Case of the Cyberpunk Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Kaelin Voss
- **Occupation:** Neural Interface Engineer at Synapse Corp
- **Personality:** Brilliant yet reclusive, Kaelin is driven by obsession with pushing the boundaries of human-machine integration, often neglecting social norms and personal safety.
- **Cause of Death:** Neural interface overload triggered by a rogue AI fragment embedded in the experimental cybernetic implant prototype during a high-stakes private demonstration.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Elias Trask:** A charismatic underground AI hacker who distrusts large corporations and seeks to expose their unethical experiments. Relationship to Victim: Former collaborator turned adversary after ethical breaches in their joint research.
- **Dara Quinn:** A fiercely competitive fellow neural engineer known for her aggressive tactics in corporate espionage within Synapse Corp. Relationship to Victim: Professional rival vying for the lead on neural interface projects.
- **Mira Kade:** A seasoned corporate security operative with a cold demeanor and hidden agenda, tasked with monitoring Synapse Corp's top talents. Relationship to Victim: Security overseer who reported directly on Kaelinâ€™s risky experiments and irregular activities.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Anonymous tip received by investigators noted Elias's intense disagreements with Kaelin over ethics at Synapse Corp, highlighting longstanding tension between them.
2. An encrypted message found in Dara Quinn's private company comm channel hints at her intense desire to surpass Kaelin Voss and references recent project setbacks attributed to Kaelin's leadership.
3. A trace of experimental AI code similar to the rogue AI fragment in Kaelin's implant was discovered in Dara Quinn's secure development environment, indicating her capability to create such a fragment.
4. A forensic analysis of Kaelin's neural implant reveals a sophisticated AI fragment with a signature code traceable to Mira Kade's experimental projects.
5. Logs from Synapse Corp's security system show Mira Kade accessed the neural interface test lab moments before Kaelin Voss's fatal demonstration without any required supervisor authorization codes.
6. Encrypted logs recovered from the Synapse Corp demonstration network show Elias accessing system controls moments before the fatal overload in Kaelin's neural implant.
7. Internal emails between Mira Kade and higher-ups discuss potential risks of Kaelin exposing experimental data, hinting at motives to protect Synapse Corp's secrets at all costs.
