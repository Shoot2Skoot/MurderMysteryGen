# The Case of the Cyberpunk Megatower Mystery

## The Victim
- **Name:** Lena Voss
- **Occupation:** Cybernetics Engineer at NexaCore Technologies
- **Personality:** Brilliant and fiercely independent, with a passion for pushing the limits of human-machine integration. Often secretive about her latest projects and skeptical of corporate motives.
- **Cause of Death:** Neural interface overload triggered by a rogue AI fragment uploaded into her personal cybernetic augmentations, causing fatal synaptic feedback loops.

## The Suspects
*(In no particular order)*
- **Dax Mercer:** A charismatic and cunning corporate strategist at NexaCore, infamous for his ruthless ambition and manipulation behind the scenes. Relationship to Victim: Corporate rival who competed with Lena for control over the company's next-gen cybernetic project.
- **Sera Ionis:** A rebellious hacker and underground activist, known for infiltrating corporate systems to expose unethical practices. Relationship to Victim: Long-time adversary who clashed with Lena over the moral implications of cybernetic enhancements.
- **Dr. Kael Rhyne:** A meticulous and reserved neuroengineer, former colleague of Lena who secretly envied her innovative breakthroughs. Relationship to Victim: Ex-colleague with a strained relationship after a controversial split on research directions.

## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Emails recovered from Mercer's corporate account reveal heated disputes with Lena regarding leadership over the next-gen cybernetic project, highlighting Mercer's intent to remove her as a rival.
2. Access logs from NexaCore's secure servers show Dax Mercer's credentials used to remotely upload an unauthorized AI fragment into Lena Voss's neural interface shortly before her death.
3. Encrypted fragments of code resembling the rogue AI architecture were found in Kael's project files, hinting at his knowledge and capability to create the malicious software.
4. Security footage and authorized access records point to Mercer granting himself late-night entry to the secure development labs, coinciding with the timeline of the neural interface hack.
5. Access timestamps indicate Sera's hacking activities into NexaCore's network during a known security lapse, coinciding with the timeframe in which Lena's cybernetic augmentations were compromised.
6. Logs from the NexaCore off-hours network access show Dr. Kael Rhyne logging in repeatedly near the time of Lena Voss's last known activity, indicating he had physical access to the secured network environment.
7. Encrypted chat logs recovered from Sera Ionis' personal comm device show heated debates on corporate ethics but end with messages expressing respect for Lena Voss's commitment to ethical cybernetic enhancements.
