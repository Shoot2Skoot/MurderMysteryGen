## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Records indicate that Marcellus arrived at the villa early on the day of the banquet and was seen frequently in the victim's private chambers, providing him with the opportunity and setting to install the deadly mechanism on the dining couch.
2. A fragment of a finely crafted stiletto coated with a rare venom matching that found on the victim's fatal wound is discovered hidden within the secret compartment of Gaius Octavius Marcellus' personal satchel.
3. A ceremonial stiletto with traces of venom was found near the dining couch's concealed mechanism, similar to one Cornelia was rumored to have admired previously.
4. Scratch marks and tool impressions found on the dining couch's mechanical device, consistent with recent tampering from someone knowledgeable about the villa's mechanisms.
5. Records show Titus had full access to the villa's main dining hall prior to the banquet and was present throughout, allowing ample opportunity to manipulate the scene without suspicion.
