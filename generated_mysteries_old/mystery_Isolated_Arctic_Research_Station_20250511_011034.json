    "name": "Dr. Elara Vostok",
    "occupation": "Glaciologist specializing in ice core analysis to uncover ancient climate patterns, recently engaged in controversial research suggesting rapid, unnatural changes beneath the ice sheet. (This role places her in conflict with other researchers and external stakeholders wary of explosive findings.)",
    "personality": "Meticulously rational and methodical in her scientific work, often appearing detached and unemotional (primary). Beneath this exterior, she harbors profound anxiety about being silenced and distrusts everyone around her, sometimes leading to secretive behavior that isolates her further (hidden/contrasting).",
    "cause_of_death": "Death caused by extinguishment of a localized pocket of breathable air within the station’s sealed laboratory, an area uniquely oxygen-starved due to a clandestine experiment altering ice sample atmospheres—leading to asphyxiation without obvious external trauma, masking foul play."

        "motive": "As a staunch defender of conventional climate research, Kreel viewed Elara's controversial findings as a threat to the station's credibility and his own career. His professional rivalry and fear of upheaval drove him to eliminate her to preserve the established scientific order.",
        "opportunity": "As a senior member of the station, Kreel had authorized access to the laboratory's control systems and was present during key research periods, enabling him to tamper with the atmospheric conditions undetected when Dr. Vostok was working alone in the sealed lab."
