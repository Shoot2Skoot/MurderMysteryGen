## The Evidence
*(In no particular order)*
1. Internal security logs show multiple failed login attempts to Kaela Voss's neural implant system originating from an executive account registered under Dr. Sylvia Yen's credentials hours before the incident.
2. Several encrypted emails were found on Sylvia Yen's NeoNimbus corporate account discussing Kaela Voss's rebellious ideas and planning to 'keep a lid on things' to maintain corporate control.
